## Abstract

Recent advances in the intrinsic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have given rise to LLM-based agent systems that exhibit near-human performance on a variety of automated tasks. However, although these systems share similarities in terms of their use of LLMs, different reasoning frameworks of the agent system steer and organize the reasoning process in different ways. In this survey, we propose a systematic taxonomy that decomposes agentic reasoning frameworks and analyze how these frameworks dominate framework-level reasoning by comparing their applications across different scenarios. Specifically, we propose an unified formal language to further classify agentic reasoning systems into single-agent methods, tool-based methods, and multi-agent methods. After that, we provide a comprehensive review of their key application scenarios in scientific discovery, healthcare, software engineering, social simulation, and economics. We also analyze the characteristic features of each framework and summarize different evaluation strategies. Our survey aims to provide the research community with a panoramic view to facilitate understanding of the strengths, suitable scenarios, and evaluation practices of different agentic reasoning frameworks.

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their powerful generalization and promising reasoning capabilities, have been rapidly reshaping numerous domains from our daily lives (e.g., idea creation, email writing, or learning of new concepts) to domain-specific research (Naveed et al., 2023). Researchers have been increasingly leveraging LLMs as core components to empower research and innovation (Liu et al., 2025c), from domain-specific knowledge Q&A (Yue, 2025) and code generation (Jiang et al., 2024b), to assisting in research endeavors (Liao et al., 2024). Through these aspects, LLMs are quickly becoming a key part of modern life and research.

Yet, despite their immense potential across various fields, LLMs have intrinsic limitations, which may limit their usefulness. For instance, LLMs often suffer from issues such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, and high training and inference costs (Huang et al., 2025b). These issues often lead to problems in the reliability and consistency of LLMs, and consequently restrict their application in critical fields like healthcare and software engineering, which demand highly dependable outcomes.

Figure 1. Number of publications regarding LLM-based Agentic Frameworks from 2020 to 2025 in journals and conferences indexed by Web of Science. For discussing method developments (§ 3), we mainly select technical papers published at top computer science conferences (e.g., ICLR, NeurIPS, ACL, EMNLP, AAAI, and ICML). To discuss about scenarios (§ 4), we collect a diverse set of representative works: from top computer science conferences (same as above) to top journals within specific domains (e.g., Nature, Science, Cell, Nat. Mach. Intell, Adv. Mater, Adv. Sci, Nat. Med, PNAS, and NAR). We observe a fast-increasing trend since 2023, showing the growing importance of the field. For 2025, we predict the overall amount of papers linearly based on data accessed at 14th August.

\Description

This image displays two line charts from 2020 to 2025, which visualize the number of publications and citations related to LLM-based Agentic Frameworks. The left chart, ”Research Trends of LLM-based Agents with Different Framework type,” shows the growth of various framework types: LLM-based Agent Frameworks, LLM-based Tool-use Agentic Frameworks, and LLM-based Multi-agent Frameworks. It also includes the total number of citations. The right chart, ”Research Trends of LLM-based Agentic Frameworks in Specific Domains,” illustrates the publication trends for four specific application domains: Scientific Discovery, Healthcare, Social and Economic Simulation, and Software Engineering. Both charts show a sharp increase in publications and citations starting in 2023, indicating a significant rise in research in this field.

To overcome this barrier, the academic community has been actively exploring the use of LLMs as a core engine to build LLM-based agentic reasoning frameworks capable of executing complex, multi-step reasoning tasks (Wang et al., 2024f; Qu et al., 2023). As illustrated in Fig. 1, we observe a significant upwards trend in terms of papers published at top conferences. Initially, “Agents” are defined in (Russell and Norvig, 2016) as systems that “perceive their environment through sensors and act upon that environment through actuators”, can dynamically adapt to their environments and take corresponding actions (Liu et al., 2025c). This emerging paradigm organically integrates key modules like planning, memory, and tool-use, reshaping the LLM into a task executor that can perceive its environment, adapt dynamically, and take sustained action (Wang et al., 2024f; Huang et al., 2024b; Li, 2025). By extending vertically, expanding horizontally, or backtracking logically, this paradigm fundamentally surpasses the single-step reasoning capabilities of traditional LLMs in both reliability and task complexity.

This trend has also been widely mirrored in industry, where tech giants are actively integrating agent workflows into their core businesses. For instance, frameworks like Microsoft’s AutoGen111 https://github.com/microsoft/autogen are designed to empower enterprises to build customized multi-agent applications. Moreover, from “vibe coding” editors like Cursor222 https://cursor.com/en/dashboard that deeply integrate agentic capabilities to autonomous AI software engineers like Devin333 https://devin.ai/, a clear evolution based on agentic reasoning frameworks is gaining widespread recognition, gradually replacing traditional development approaches.

However, at the same time, the explosive growth in this field has also blurred the boundaries of LLM-based agents (Yehudai et al., 2025). For instance, the overlap with concepts from areas like traditional multi-agent systems (Gronauer and Diepold, 2022; Zhang et al., 2024c; Chai et al., 2025b) and autonomous systems (Tang et al., 2022) makes it difficult to define the scope of research. Meanwhile, it is often hard to clearly separate whether enhanced capabilities of an agent come from careful framework design, model-level improvements, or technological advancements. This dual ambiguity poses a serious challenge for the horizontal comparison of different projects and risks overlooking the foundational role of framework design in an agent system’s reasoning ability.

Therefore, we believe that it is timely for a survey to systematically summarize the recent progress and application scenarios of agentic reasoning frameworks. We first clearly define the boundaries of these frameworks and, based on that, propose a unified methodological classification system. We then further analyze the application and evaluation strategies of these methods across diverse scenarios, aiming to provide a clear roadmap for the standardized and safe development of agentic developments. Our taxonomy also fits the current popular topics like context engineering.

Overall, the contributions of our survey are as follows:

•

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey that proposes a unified methodological taxonomy to systematically highlight the core reasoning mechanisms and methods within agentic frameworks;

•

We employ a formal language to describe the reasoning process, clearly illustrating the impact of different methods on key steps;

•

We extensively investigate the application of agent reasoning frameworks in several key scenarios. In these application scenarios, we conduct in-depth analyses of representative works according to our proposed taxonomy, and present a collection of evaluation setups with datasets.

The structure of the survey is as follows: Chapter § 2 will further introduce compare the difference between related surveys and our survey. Chapter § 3 will present the taxonomy of techniques, which systematically analyses the existing techniques for agentic reasoning. Chapter § 4 will further provide application scenarios of agentic reasoning frameworks, and how agents in each scenario are often designed. Lastly, Chapter § 5 will discuss future directions and Chapter § 6 states the conclusion of the survey.

## 2. Related Surveys

Recent surveys on agentic AI have explored the agentic reasoning landscape from several valuable perspectives. A primary focus has been model-centric, examining how to enhance the agentic capabilities of LLMs. For instance, several surveys (Ke et al., 2025; Sun et al., 2025; Xu et al., 2025) review training methodologies such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). Other surveys also explore the potential of smaller, specialized agentic models on specific reasoning tasks(Belcak et al., 2025), or examine the planning abilities of agentic foundation models (Li, 2025; Huang et al., 2024b). Overall, these surveys primarily focus on the “LLM” side developments of LLM-based agents.

Yet, recently in the field of LLM-based agents, numerous representative methods about agentic frameworks have emerged, which explore how to leverage state-of-the-art LLMs with training-free methods to build agentic frameworks through framework-level reasoning. However, to the best of our knowledge, there still has not been a survey that systematically organizes these “framework” side developments and discusses their value in various application scenarios. Therefore, in contrast to other surveys, our survey specifically concentrates on agentic reasoning frameworks, reviewing the most recent development on framework-level agentic reasoning methods, instead of orthogonal developments in model architectures and fine-tuning techniques. We categorize existing methods along three progressive dimensions: single-agent, tool-based, and multi-agent, and propose a unified taxonomy to analyze the different stages of the multi-step reasoning process, which has not been explored in previous surveys.

Closer to our work, there are surveys exploring how agentic technologies could be used within specific domains, such as scientific discovery (Gridach et al., 2025; Ren et al., 2025), software engineering (Jin et al., 2024), medicine (Wang et al., 2025d), or social sciences (Ding et al., 2024). However, their scope is often limited and focuses only on a single specific domain, which can significantly increase the difficulty when comparing between agentic frameworks across different domains. For instance, each of these surveys utilizes a different way to categorize and list the research works, this makes it difficult to observe the abilities and trends of LLM agents at the frontier of research or the special designs in each scenario, since there is no unified taxonomy of these methods. Thus, we propose a systematic taxonomy which provides a unified view of LLM agentic frameworks. This allows us to systematically analyze how the unique requirements of each application scenario shape the design and adaptation of these frameworks in those scenarios, thereby bridging the gap between methods and application scenarios. Furthermore, our survey adopts a scenario-driven approach to trace and compare the evaluation setups and datasets used in each representative works, across different application domains. To the best of our knowledge, such systematic exploration of agentic reasoning and evaluation setups across different scenarios has not yet been explored.

Figure 2. Taxonomy of our proposed agentic reasoning frameworks. We decompose agentic reasoning methods into three progressive categories: a) single-agent methods, b) tool-based methods, and c) multi-agent methods.

\Description

This image presents a detailed, hierarchical breakdown of agentic reasoning frameworks. The taxonomy is organized into three main categories: Single-agent Methods, which focus on prompt engineering and self-improvement techniques; Tool-based Methods, which cover how agents integrate, select, and utilize external tools; and Multi-agent Methods, which describe how multiple agents are organized and how they interact with each other. The diagram effectively visualizes the various sub-categories within each method, such as reflection, iterative optimization, and different forms of tool integration and agent interaction. This structure provides a clear and comprehensive overview of the different approaches used in designing agentic reasoning systems.

## 3. Methods

Extended from Foundation LLMs, agentic reasoning frameworks is a key development in order to achieve a autonomous and environmental-aware systems which could solve complicated problems in the real world. In this section, we propose a taxonomy to categorize these methods. At the top, we deconstruct the reasoning framework into three distinct levels, namely single-agent, external tool calling, and multi-agent, as shown in Figure 2. Single-agent methods focus on enhancing the reasoning capability of individual agents; tool-based methods extend the boundaries of agent reasoning through external tools; and multi-agent methods enable more flexible reasoning through different paradigms of organization and interaction among multiple agents. We cover these levels in Chapters § 3.2, § 3.3, § 3.4 respectively, after we introduce the notations in Chapter § 3.1. Together, these methods at different levels can be integrated in different ways to fulfill specific scenarios, which is covered in Chapter § 4.

### 3.1. Notations

We highlight that agent systems can achieve their goals through a complete process that includes multiple reasoning steps. Multi-agent systems can further execute a complete reasoning process under the collaboration of different agents (Tran et al., 2025). To clearly introduce this complex process, we propose a general reasoning algorithm (Alg. 1) and a notation table (Table 1) in this section, which brings another level of abstraction. In the subsequent chapters (Chapters § 3.2, § 3.3, and § 3.4), we will further discuss how each representative line of works improve the reasoning performances by modifying or adjusting this general algorithm.

Table 1. Notations Used in This Chapter

| Notation | Description |
| --- | --- |
| PUP_{U} | The user’s input query. |
| QQ | The termination condition for the reasoning process. |
| gg | The set of predefined goals to be achieved. |
| tt | An external tool available to the agent. |
| 𝒞\mathcal{C} | The internal context of an agent. |
| yy | The output of an agent after an action. |
| kk | A count of reasoning steps. |
| 𝒜\mathcal{A} | The entire action space, containing all possible actions. |
| aa | A general action that produces an output from a given input. |
| a′a^{\prime} | An action that updates the current context based on an input. |
| areasona_{\text{reason}} | An action that performs a step of deep reasoning. |
| atoola_{\text{tool}} | An action that involves an interaction with an external tool tt. |
| areflecta_{\text{reflect}} | An action to reflect on and evaluate previous reasoning steps. |

A key differentiator between an agentic system and a standard Large Language Model is the ability to perform multi-step reasoning (Guo et al., 2024). This capability relies on the active management of a persistent context throughout the lifecycle of a task within the agentic system (Mei et al., 2025). While a standard LLM processes a given context to produce a single-step output, an agent system, base on its various action choice, iteratively updates its context to support a multi-step reasoning. Each action, though has different targets or intentions, follows a similar logic to tackle such input-output relations. Therefore, we formalize a single reasoning step as an operation where the agent executes an action aa based on its current context 𝒞\mathcal{C} to produce an output yy, expressed as y=a​(𝒞)y=a(\mathcal{C}). A full reasoning process will contain several such reasoning steps.

The outputs and insights from the preceding steps are preserved within this context, enabling the agent to build upon its prior work (Mei et al., 2025). We explicitly distinguish the action of generating an output (aa) from the action of updating the state (a′a^{\prime}). This separation is crucial because the objective of a context update (e.g., summarizing history, integrating a tool’s results) often differs from that of producing a final or intermediate answer (Mei et al., 2025).

To execute these steps, the agent selects actions from a generalized action space 𝒜\mathcal{A}, which we define for our purposes as 𝒜={areason,atool,areflect}\mathcal{A}=\{a_{\text{reason}},a_{\text{tool}},a_{\text{reflect}}\}. To maintain focus on the reasoning logic, our framework abstracts complex auxiliary components, such as memory modules (Zhang et al., 2024a), knowledge retrieval (Zhao et al., 2024b), sandboxed environments (Durante et al., 2024), and human interruption (Natarajan et al., 2025) into a unified external tool tt. This is because they are mainly act as an external source that could provides agent with external knowledge and information. The action atoola_{\text{tool}} is specifically designed and used to invoke this tool, providing the agent with necessary external information or capabilities. While this action space is sufficient for our analysis, it can be extended or tailored for specific domains (Wang and Anandkumar, 2023).

Consequently, a complete reasoning task is modeled as an iterative sequence of actions The process is initiated by a user query PUP_{U} and proceeds until a predefined termination condition QQ is met. This condition is essential for ensuring controlled execution and conserving computational resources (Tran et al., 2025). Building on the notations in Table 1, we formalize this multi-step reasoning process in Algorithm 1. The comments within the algorithm serve as forward references, indicating which of the methodologies discussed in subsequent sections modify a particular step of the general procedure.

9:return Final output derived from 𝒞k\mathcal{C}_{k}

### 3.2. Single-agent Methods

Single-Agent methods focus on enhancing the cognitive and decision-making abilities of an individual agent. From the perspectives of external guidance and internal optimization, this part categorizes single-agent methods into two main types: prompt engineering and self-improvement. Prompt engineering emphasizes guiding the agent’s reasoning process by leveraging roles, environments, tasks, and examples, while self-improvement focuses on how the agent refines its reasoning strategies through reflection, iteration, and interaction.

#### 3.2.1. Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering enhances the agent’s performance by enriching its initial context, which corresponds to the context initialization step (line 1 in Alg. 1). (Schulhoff et al., 2024). Instead of relying solely on the user’s query (PUP_{U}), this approach augments the initial context 𝒞0\mathcal{C}_{0} with a meticulously crafted prompt, denoted as P∗P^{*}. This conceptual shift can be represented as:

| (1) | 𝒞0←Init​(PU)→Prom. Eng.𝒞0←Init​(PU,P∗)\mathcal{C}_{0}\leftarrow\text{Init}(P_{U})\quad\xrightarrow{\text{Prom. Eng.}}\quad\mathcal{C}_{0}\leftarrow\text{Init}(P_{U},P^{*}) |
| --- | --- |

Equation 1 illustrates that the initialization process is transformed. Originally, the context 𝒞0\mathcal{C}_{0} is derived exclusively from the user query PUP_{U}. With prompt engineering, it is initialized with both PUP_{U} and the engineered prompt P∗P^{*}. This additional prompt P∗P^{*} is often a composite of several components: a role-playing perspective (ProleP_{\text{role}}), an environment simulation (PenvP_{\text{env}}), a detailed task clarification (Pt​a​s​kP_{task}), and a set of in-context examples (Pi​c​lP_{icl}). Unlike fine-tuning methods, which alters the LLM’s parameters, prompt engineering guides the model’s behavior non-intrusively, steering the agent towards more accurate and predictable reasoning outcomes (Liu et al., 2023b). Each component of P∗P^{*} contributes to this guidance in a distinct way, as detailed below and illustrated in Fig. 3.

Figure 3. Prompt engineerng for agentic reasoning framework. We summarize four types of methods: a) Role-playing: an agent will be distributed with a specific role, to stimulate its specific performance; b) Environmental-simulation: an agent will be told in a carefully designed environment, where it can reason with multi-modalities or external abilities; c) Task-description: a task will be clearly reconstructed and expressed to an agent; d) In-context Learning: several examples will be provided to an agent before or during its multi-step reasoning. For each type of prompting method, we provide a short example prompt, with the theme of conducting agentic research.

\Description

This image is a detailed diagram illustrating four types of Prompt Engineering methods for agentic reasoning frameworks. The diagram breaks down each method with a short description and a corresponding example.

##### Role-Playing

To instill a role-playing perspective (Pr​o​l​eP_{role}), the prompt assigns the agent a specific persona or identity, such as “You are an expert data scientist” or “Act as a seasoned historian” (Shanahan et al., 2023). This encourages the agent to leverage the expertise, cognitive frameworks, and linguistic styles associated with that role (Salewski et al., 2024). By adopting a persona, the model can better activate domain-specific knowledge and structure its responses from a more professional viewpoint during reasoning (Kong et al., 2024). This technique has become a widely adopted method in the agentic frameworks discussed in chapter § 4, owing to its low deployment cost and high guidance efficiency. By assigning a clear role, it enables agents to better focus on their specific duties, thereby optimizing their reasoning and decision-making processes in complex tasks. However, the efficiency of role assignment can be sensitive to the granularity of the persona design and the specifics of the task (Kim et al., 2024c). Furthermore, for fact-based questions, role-playing may introduce biases inherent to the persona, potentially leading to factually inaccurate outputs (Li et al., 2024a).

##### Environment Simulation

The environment simulation prompt (Pe​n​vP_{env}) contextualizes the agent by describing the specific setting in which it operates. This provides task-relevant background information, rules, and constraints, enabling the agent to make decisions that are better aligned with the simulated world. These environments can range from mimicking real-world scenarios, such as a stock market (Fatemi and Hu, 2024) or a medical clinic (Fan et al., 2025), to entirely virtual settings like a video game world (Wang and Anandkumar, 2023), often with a action space that are carefully designed. A detailed and task-relevant environmental description is critical, as it prompts the agent to generate actions that are contextually appropriate and highly correlated with the scenario’s objectives.

##### Task Description

A clear task description (Pt​a​s​kP_{task}), which outlines the primary goal gg, constraints, and expected output format, is a cornerstone of virtually every agent system. A well-structured task description guides the agent in decomposing a complex problem into a sequence of manageable sub-tasks. By providing a precise description, agents can better comprehend the task’s intent and execute it in the specified manner, which effectively reduces ambiguity during the reasoning process and leads to more accurate outcomes (Min et al., 2022). However, the verbosity and structure of the task description can significantly impact the performance of the underlying LLM, often requiring careful optimization tailored to the specific model being used (Levy et al., 2024).

##### In-context Learning

In-context learning (ICL) provides the agent with a set of few-shot examples, or demonstrations, within the prompt (Pi​c​lP_{icl}). These examples typically take the form of pairs {(x1,z1),(x2,z2),…,(xn,zn)}\{(x_{1},z_{1}),(x_{2},z_{2}),\dots,(x_{n},z_{n})\}, where each pair (xj,zj)(x_{j},z_{j}) consists of an exemplary input xjx_{j} and its corresponding desired output zjz_{j} (Brown et al., 2020). This allows the agent to discern patterns and generalize to new task instances without any gradient updates. Chain-of thought prompting (Wei et al., 2022) further porvides a paradigms that the intermediate reasoning steps could also be brought to agent, teaching agents how to reason, plan and break down problems without internal tuning (Zhang et al., 2025f). However, the performance of ICL is highly sensitive to the quality and relevance of the provided examples; low-quality or irrelevant demonstrations can significantly degrade the agent’s reasoning capabilities (Li and Qiu, 2023).

#### 3.2.2. Self-Improvement

Self-improvement mechanisms encourage an agent to enhance its reasoning capabilities through introspection and autonomous learning. Rather than relying on static, pre-defined prompts, these methods enable the agent to dynamically adapt its strategies based on its own experiences. As summarized in Fig. 4, this internal optimization process can be understood through three complementary paradigms: reflection, which involves learning from past trajectories; iterative optimization, which focuses on refining outputs within a single reasoning cycle; and interactive learning, which allows for the dynamic adjustment of high-level goals in response to environmental feedback.

Figure 4. Paradigms of self-improvement for an LLM-based agent. We introduce three core mechanisms. a) Reflection: The agent analyzes a completed trajectory to generate a textual summary, storing in its context. This summary will helps for the next reasoning step. b) Iterative Optimization: Within a single task, the agent generates an initial output, compares it against a defined standard or feedback from others, and repeatedly refines it in following reasoning steps, until QQ is met. c) Interactive Learning: The agent interacts with a dynamic environment, where experiences (e.g., discovering a new item) can trigger an update to its high-level goals, fostering continuous, open-ended learning.

\Description

This image illustrates three core paradigms for self-improvement in an LLM-based agent: Reflection, Iterative Optimization, and Interactive Learning.

##### Reflection

Reflection enables an agent to perform post-hoc analysis on its past actions and outcomes to extract valuable lessons for future tasks. This process involves generating a summary of its reasoning process, identifying flaws or inefficiencies, and articulating insights in natural language (Guo et al., 2025b). This process refers to line 5 in Alg. 1, where the action ak′a_{k}^{{}^{\prime}} is specifically assigned as reflection ar​e​f​l​e​c​ta_{reflect}:

| (2) | Ck+1=ar​e​f​l​e​c​t′​(Ck,yk+1,g,t)C_{k+1}=a_{reflect}^{{}^{\prime}}(C_{k},y_{k+1},g,t) |
| --- | --- |

The scope of reflection can vary. For instance, the Reflexion framework (Shinn et al., 2023) guides agents to verbally reflect on task failures, storing these reflections in an episodic memory to refine plans in subsequent trials. Other approaches have explored reflecting on different aspects, such as inefficient reasoning paths (Zhou et al., 2023) or conflicting information from external tools (Pan et al., 2023). This self-correction capability allows the agent to learn from its mistakes and continuously adapt its strategies without requiring external intervention or parameter updates.

##### Iterative Optimization

In contrast to the post-hoc nature of reflection, iterative optimization utilize a whole reasoning process to complete a pre-defined standard or constraint, which we denoted as 𝒮\mathcal{S}. This mechanism introduces two key modifications to the agent’s fundamental operation described in Alg. 1.

First, the standard 𝒮\mathcal{S} is incorporated into the agent’s initial context. This modification of the initialization step (line 1 in Alg. 1) ensures that agent is aware of the optimization target from the outset:

| (3) | 𝒞0←Init​(PU)→Iter. Opt.𝒞0←Init​(PU,𝒮)\mathcal{C}_{0}\leftarrow\text{Init}(P_{U})\quad\xrightarrow{\text{Iter. Opt.}}\quad\mathcal{C}_{0}\leftarrow\text{Init}(P_{U},\mathcal{S}) |
| --- | --- |

Equation 3 shows that the context initialization is augmented to include not just the user’s query PUP_{U}, but also the explicit standard 𝒮\mathcal{S} that the final output must satisfy. Second, the agent’s autonomy to decide when to stop is replaced by 𝒮\mathcal{S}. The general termination condition Q is now precisely defined by whether the current output y satisfies the standard S. This can be expressed as a formal redefinition of Q (line 3 in Alg. 1):

| (4) | Q→Iter. Opt.Q≜(y⊨𝒮)Q\quad\xrightarrow{\text{Iter. Opt.}}\quad Q\triangleq(y\vDash\mathcal{S}) |
| --- | --- |

As stated in Equation 4, the termination condition QQ is now defined as the predicate checking if the current output yy satisfies the standard 𝒮\mathcal{S}. Consequently, after each reasoning step that produces an output, the agent checks it against 𝒮\mathcal{S}, entering an iterative loop of refinement until the condition is met. This iterative loop is central to frameworks like Self-Refine (Madaan et al., 2023a), where a single LLM acts as its own generator, critic, and refiner to improve its output without external training data. This approach is particularly effective for tasks requiring high precision, such as code generation (Gou et al., 2024a) or mathematical reasoning (AhmadiTeshnizi et al., 2024). However, it can be computationally intensive and risks converging on a suboptimal solution if the feedback mechanism is flawed or the search space is too complex (Pan et al., 2025).

##### Interactive Learning

Representing the most advanced level of self-improvement, interactive learning allows an agent to fundamentally alter its high-level goals gg based on continuous interaction with a dynamic environment. This paradigm moves beyond optimizing a fixed plan to enabling the agent to decide what to do next on a strategic level. This corresponds to an enhancement of the goal-updating mechanism (line 6 in Alg. 1), where the goal gg is no longer static but is re-evaluated at each step:

| (5) | gk+1←ak​({(𝒞i,yi)}i=1k,gk,t)g_{k+1}\leftarrow a_{k}(\{(\mathcal{C}_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{k},g_{k},t) |
| --- | --- |

Equation 5 shows that the new goal gk+1g_{k+1} is derived from the entire history of contexts and outputs {(𝒞i,yi)}i=1k\{(\mathcal{C}_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{k}, the current goal gkg_{k}, and available tools tt. Voyager (Wang and Anandkumar, 2023) exemplify this, where an agent in Minecraft autonomously proposes new goals based on its discoveries, gradually building a complex skill tree without human intervention. Similarly, ExpeL (Zhao et al., 2024a) enables an agent to learn from trial-and-error experiences, creating a memory of successful and failed attempts that informs the generation of more promising goals in future tasks. Further systematizing this process, Learn-by-Interact (Hongjin et al., 2025) introduces a data-centric framework where an agent autonomously collects interaction data and then distills it into a reusable knowledge base, thereby enabling structured, self-adaptive behavior in complex environments. By dynamically adapting its objectives, the agent demonstrates a higher form of autonomy, allowing it to navigate complex, evolving environments in a truly adaptive manner (Zheng et al., 2025).

### 3.3. Tool-based Methods

While the general agentic reasoning framework (Alg. 1) conceptualizes tool use via a single entity tt, this abstraction is insufficient for complex scenarios where reasoning is deeply intertwined with specific environmental capabilities. Here we expand this single entity tt into a comprehensive toolkit 𝒯={t1,t2,…,tn}\mathcal{T}=\{t_{1},t_{2},...,t_{n}\}, where each tit_{i} represents a distinct tool available to the agent. As illustrated in Fig. 5, we deconstruct the tool-based reasoning pipeline into three fundamental stages: Tool Integration, Tool Selection, and Tool Utilization. Generally, the output from tool calling will be integrated into the context of agent by a specific action (line 5 in Alg. 1). These three steps together form the tool-based methods for complex multi-step reasoning, helping agents better exploit external resources to solve complex reasoning problems.

Figure 5. Tool-based reasoning frameworks of LLM-based agent. a) Tool integration studies how to incorporate tools into the agent’s reasoning process; b) Tool Selection addresses which tool from the toolkit 𝒯\mathcal{T} is most suitable for the current task or sub-problem; c) Tool Utilization concerns how to effectively operate the chosen tool to generate the desired output.

\Description

This image is a diagram that illustrates the three main components of a Tool-based reasoning framework for an LLM-based agent. The first component, Tool Integration, shows how tools can be incorporated into an agent’s reasoning process through APIs, Plugins, or Middleware. The second, Tool Selection, describes the decision-making process for choosing the most suitable tool from a toolkit, using methods that are either automated, rule-based, or learning-based. The third, Tool Utilization, details how the selected tools are operated to generate a desired output, with examples of sequential, parallel, and iterative execution.

#### 3.3.1. Tool Integration

Before an agent select and utilize a tool, the tool must first be made accessible within the agent’s operational environment. This architectural integration defines the interface and communication protocol between the agent and the tool (Ehtesham et al., 2025). We categorize these integration patterns into three primary models: API-based Integration, Plugin-based Integration, and Middleware-based Integration. APIs enable agents to easily interact with various tools without needing to understand their internal implementations; plugins dynamically extend the functionality of the agent system; while middleware focuses on aligning the interactions between the agent and the tools.

##### API-based Integration

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide standard for integrating external tools (Zhang et al., 2025a). APIs provide a stable, well-documented contract that allows an agent to interact with a tool (e.g., a web search engine (Chen et al., 2025c)) without needing to understand its internal implementation. The agent simply learns to formulate a request according to the API specification and parse the returned data.

Emerging Agent protocols such as MCP further develop the diversity of API tools. Under the corporation of service provider, agents now can easily use precise services such as map navigation to provide detailed information for the user (Hou et al., 2025). But such integration is subject to network latency, rate limits, and potential service outages. It also requires the agent to manage authentication and security credentials (Hou et al., 2025).

##### Plugin-based Integration

Plugins are software components that are loaded and executed directly within the agent’s own runtime environment. Unlike external API calls, plugins operate with lower latency and have deeper access to the agent’s internal state (Lyu et al., 2023).

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is a typical case of plugin-based integration. A vector database is integrated directly into the agent system, introducing domain-specific knowledge to the agent in the form of a tool call, thereby increasing the credibility of its answers (Gao et al., 2023b). Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2025b) offers a more specific application of plugins. By integrating an interactive heatmap plugin and a scatter plot plugin, the agent system is enabled to dynamically process, analyze, and visualize domain-specific data during its reasoning process. Thus, plugins offer a higher level of customization, extending the edge of agenic framework’s core abilities, but it may introduce complexity to the overall system (Hofstätter et al., 2023).

##### Middleware-based Integration

Middleware is a software layer situated between the Agent and tools (Gu et al., 2024). This layer acts as a universal adapter or an “operating environment” for the agent, abstracting away the complexities of direct tool interaction, shielding the LLM from environmental complexity (Gu et al., 2024). A middleware layer could manage API keys, standardize data formats across different tools, or provide a unified file system and execution environment for the agent (Xie et al., 2024). Therefore, middleware simplifies the agent’s logic by offloading complex tasks, providing a consistent interface over a heterogeneous set of tools. Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2025f) further propose Internet of Agents, highlighting advantages of middleware in complex reasonoing process. However, it adds another layer of abstraction that can complicate maintenance.

#### 3.3.2. Tool Selection

Instead of generally using tool tt in each reasoning step (line 4 and 5 of Alg. 1), here we want to highlight the importance of the selecting action of tool within reasoning steps. Effective tool selection is pivotal when an agent is presented with a large and diverse toolkit 𝒯\mathcal{T}. The challenge lies in accurately mapping the requirements of a given problem to the specific choice of a tool tt, where t∈𝒯t\in\mathcal{T}. Based on the degree of agent autonomy, we categorize tool selection strategies into three primary approaches: Autonomous Selection, Ru-Based Selection, and Learning-Based Selection.

##### Autonomous Selection

This paradigm highlights the autonomy of agentic systems. The agent autonomously selects a tool based on its intrinsic reasoning capabilities, guided solely by the natural language descriptions of the available tools and the input query (Zhang et al., 2024b). This process is often framed as a zero-shot reasoning task, where the agent must “think” to connect the problem to the right tool without explicit rules (Yao et al., 2023).

Just like a general reasoning step, the tool selection step will let agent reason, reflect, or even use tools to decide which tool tk+1t_{k+1} is suited for current condition, this tool tk+1t_{k+1} can be regarded as the output yy within this reasoning step:

| (6) | yk+1←tk+1=ak​(Ck,g,𝒯),ak∈𝒜y_{k+1}\leftarrow t_{k+1}=a_{k}(C_{k},g,\mathcal{T}),a_{k}\in\mathcal{A} |
| --- | --- |

Following line 5 in Alg. 1, the selected tool tk+1t_{k+1} is updated into the current context window, allowing the agent to use it in subsequent reasoning steps. This selection process may sometimes be repeated multiple times to gradually filter for the best tools from a large toolset (Li et al., 2025b). Since this method requires no task-specific examples or fine-tuning, it enables the agent to dynamically adapt to novel combinations of tools, tasks and scenarios. However, its performance is highly dependent on the quality of tool descriptions and the agent’s inherent reasoning capacity, which challenges the robustness and efficiency of the agent system.

##### Rule-Based Selection

This approach governs agent’s tool selection through a set of predefined, explicit rules ℛ\mathcal{R} that map specific tasks, intents, or states to designated tools (Luo et al., 2025). These rules provide a deterministic and reliable mechanism for tool choice. The selection process is thus conditioned on these rules:

| (7) | tk+1=ak​(Ck,g,𝒯,ℛ),ak∈𝒜t_{k+1}=a_{k}(C_{k},g,\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}),a_{k}\in\mathcal{A} |
| --- | --- |

The rules in ℛ\mathcal{R} can be implemented in various forms, from simple keyword matching (Liu et al., 2024d) to structured formats like process description language (PDL) (Zhou et al., 2024a).

The main benefit of rule-based selection is its high reliability for well-defined tasks. It ensures that the agent consistently uses the correct tool for a known situation, minimizing errors (Li, 2025). However, manually crafting and maintaining a comprehensive set of rules is labor-intensive and scales poorly as the number of tools and the complexity of tasks grow. It struggles with unforeseen problems that do not match any existing rules, forcing a default failure or a fallback to a different selection mechanism.

##### Learning-Based Selection

Learning-based selection in this context refers to an explicit, online process where the agent refines its tool selection strategy during inference (Schick et al., 2023). This adaptation occurs through a cycle of action, feedback, and reflection, improving its concurrent tool actions. As demonstrated in figure. 5, the agent attempts a tool for task, receives feedback on its performance (e.g., from execution results, or human guidance), and then explicitly reflects on this outcome to update its context 𝒞\mathcal{C} for subsequent steps:

| (8) | Ck+1=areflection′​(Ck,yk,g)C_{k+1}=a^{\prime}_{\text{reflection}}(C_{k},y_{k},g) |
| --- | --- |

This reflective step allows the agent to learn from its own context by storing experiences of successful tool-task pairings or by generating explicit strategies to avoid repeating past mistakes (Qin et al., 2024a). This approach enables the agent to adapt to novel scenarios and user preferences without requiring model retraining. Learn-By-Interact (Hongjin et al., 2025) achieves a interactive learning by synthesizing trajectories of agent-environment interactions based on documentations, and constructs instructions by summarizing or abstracting the interaction histories. However, a good feedback logic is necessary, and such exploring process can be costed.

#### 3.3.3. Tool Utilization

Following the previous section, this section focus on how to make the best use of the selected tools (Masterman et al., 2024). Here we divide tool utilization into three modes: sequential use, parallel use, and iterative use. Sequential use involves invoking multiple tools in a predetermined order, parallel use focuses on the breadth of tool calls within the same reasoning step, while iterative use aims at achieving the optimal task solution within certain limits through repeated cycles.

##### Sequential Utilization

In this mode, the agent invokes tools in a sequence, where the output of one tool often serves as the input for the next, forming a clear tool-chain (Li, 2025). This is well-suited for tasks that can be decomposed into a linear workflow. The results of tool calling are integrated into the current context, influencing the next calling (Basu et al., 2024). CRITIC (Gou et al., 2024b) improve its output through a sequential use of external tools, including search engine and code interpreter. MCP-Zero (Fei et al., 2025) further promote tool discovery based on the tool chain, where agent sequentially use different tool to solve complex problems. Its primary benefit is simplicity and predictability, making workflows easy to design, analyze and debug. But sometimes it’s inefficiency for tasks with independent sub-problems and susceptibility to cascading failures, where an error in an early step halts the entire chain.

##### Parallel Utilization

To enhance efficiency, this mode involves invoking multiple tools concurrently within a single reasoning step. The Agent invokes multiple tools simultaneously to achieve synchronous processing of multidimensional information. For a selected tool set 𝒯′={t1′,t2′,…,tm′}\mathcal{T}^{{}^{\prime}}=\{t_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},t_{2}^{{}^{\prime}},...,t_{m}^{{}^{\prime}}\} in any middle reasoning step kk, the agent will generate a group of results in parallel using each tool within 𝒯′\mathcal{T^{\prime}}. That is, for line 4 in Alg. 1, the output will becomes a set of output:

| (9) | 𝒴k+1={yk+11,yk+12,…,yk+1m}where ​yk+1i=ak​(𝒞k,g,ti′),ak∈𝒜,ti′∈𝒯′\begin{gathered}\mathcal{Y}_{k+1}=\{y_{k+1}^{1},y_{k+1}^{2},\dots,y_{k+1}^{m}\}\\ \text{where }y^{i}_{k+1}=a_{k}(\mathcal{C}_{k},g,t^{\prime}_{i}),\quad a_{k}\in\mathcal{A},\quad t^{\prime}_{i}\in\mathcal{T^{\prime}}\end{gathered} |
| --- | --- |

After that, the update of context will further consider this output set 𝒴k+1\mathcal{Y}_{k+1}(Zhu et al., 2025), instead of a single output like before:

| (10) | Ck+1=ak′​(𝒴k+1,Ck,g),ak′∈𝒜C_{k+1}=a_{k}^{{}^{\prime}}(\mathcal{Y}_{k+1},C_{k},g),a^{\prime}_{k}\in\mathcal{A} |
| --- | --- |

The key advantage is a significant reduction in latency, as multiple time-consuming tool utilization can be executed at once. It’s also efficiency to explore several proper tools simultaneously. For example, LLM Compiler (Kim et al., 2024a) efficiently orchestrates multiple function calls by executing them in parallel during intermediate reasoning steps, while LLM-Tool Compiler (Singh et al., 2024b) achieves tool parallelization by selectively fusing tools with similar functionalities. But such techniques may also introduce the challenge of aggregating potentially conflicting information from diverse outputs.

##### Iterative Utilization

Iterative utilization involves a micro-level loop where an agent repeatedly interacts with a tool to achieve a fine-grained objective within a single step of the broader reasoning process (Madaan et al., 2023b). This contrasts with macro-level iterative optimization of the entire solution in § 3.2.2. The focus here is on perfecting a single tool-use instance. A prime example is an agent using a code interpreter: if the first execution fails, the agent inspects the error, refines the code, and re-executes it until it runs successfully, all before moving to the next macro reasoning step (He et al., 2024). This method enhances the robustness of tool execution, but may increase the latency of a single reasoning step and carries the risk of getting stuck in unproductive loops (Pan et al., 2025). This necessitates carefully designed termination conditions or reflection mechanisms (Shinn et al., 2023).

### 3.4. Multi-agent Methods

While single-agent frameworks demonstrates considerable capabilities, they inherently face limitations when confronted with tasks demanding diverse expertise or complex problem decomposition. Multi-agent systems (MAS) emerge as a natural solution, leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple agents to tackle these challenges. The central principle of MAS is to “divide and conquer”, but its core challenge lies in achieving effective coordination (Tran et al., 2025). This challenge bifurcates into two fundamental questions: (1) How should the agents be organized? This pertains to the system’s organizational architecture, which dictates the patterns of control and information flow. (2) How should the agents interact with others? This relates to the individual interaction protocols, which define how agents align their goals and behaviors.

As illustrated in Figure 6, we analyze the multi-agent reasoning frameworks along these two axes. Organizational architectures include centralized, distributed, and hierarchical forms, which determine the structural backbone of the system; while individual interactions involve cooperation, competition, and negotiation, governing the dynamics between agents as they pursue their objectives.

Figure 6. A taxonomy of Multi-agent reasoning frameworks, categorized in a) Organizational Architectures: we summarize three paradigms of multi-agent frameworks to explain how such system can be organized to solve different kinds of challenges; b) Individual Interactions: we demonstrated three types of interaction between different agents within one multi-agent system.

\Description

This image is a taxonomy of multi-agent reasoning frameworks, divided into two primary categories: Organizational Architectures and Individual Interactions.

To formally discuss these paradigms, we represent a multi-agent system as a set of agents ℳ={Ar1,Ar2,…,Arn}\mathcal{M}=\{A^{r_{1}},A^{r_{2}},...,A^{r_{n}}\}, where rir_{i} denotes the specialized role of an agent AriA^{r_{i}}. While each agent adheres to the general reasoning loop outlined in Alg. 1, its behavior is individuated by its unique role, goal gig^{i}, available actions aia^{i} and tool tit^{i}. They also maintain different individual context 𝒞i\mathcal{C}^{i}. It is the distinctiveness of each agent’s context and role that drives the heterogeneity in their reasoning, ultimately shaping the system’s collective output.

#### 3.4.1. Organizational Architecture

The organizational architecture defines the macro-level structure for coordination and control, which is often instantiated by assigning a specific role rir_{i} to each agent’s initial context 𝒞0ri\mathcal{C}_{0}^{r_{i}}:

| (11) | 𝒞0←PU⇒𝒞0ri←(PU,ri)\mathcal{C}_{0}\leftarrow P_{U}\Rightarrow\mathcal{C}_{0}^{r_{i}}\leftarrow(P_{U},r_{i}) |
| --- | --- |

Extend from line 5 in Alg. 1, each agent, no matter under what organization, their update of context must consider all other agents’ output, with their previous context ykriy_{k}^{r_{i}}, which would be formalized as:

| (12) | 𝒞k+1ri=ak′​(Ckri,𝒴k,gri,tri),ak′∈𝒜where​𝒴k={ykr1,ykr2,…,ykrn}\begin{gathered}\mathcal{C}_{k+1}^{r_{i}}=a_{k}^{{}^{\prime}}(C_{k}^{r_{i}},\mathcal{Y}_{k},g^{r_{i}},t^{r_{i}}),a^{\prime}_{k}\in\mathcal{A}\\ \text{where}\mathcal{Y}_{k}=\{y_{k}^{r_{1}},y_{k}^{r_{2}},...,y_{k}^{r_{n}}\}\end{gathered} |
| --- | --- |

Here, 𝒴k\mathcal{Y}_{k} represents the collective outputs of all the nn agents at reasoning step kk. The specific subset of 𝒴k\mathcal{Y}_{k} that an agent AriA^{r_{i}} considers is determined by different organizational architecture. We further decompose the organization of multi-agent systems into three distinct paradigms: centralized, decentralized, and hierarchical. A centralized architecture is suitable for scenarios requiring global optimization and strict control; a distributed architecture offers greater autonomy for each agent; while a hierarchical architecture is appropriate for tasks with clear goals and well-defined processes. These paradigms can be statically or dynamically integrated, reaching a flexible organization structure in specific scenarios (Liu et al., 2025c).

##### Centralized

In general, a centralized architecture set a central agent Ac​e​nA^{cen} to manage and coordinate the reasoning activities for other agents, AriA^{r_{i}} where r≠c​e​nr\neq cen (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024). But their is a difference. This central agent Ac​e​nA^{cen} typically performs global planning, task decomposition, and result synthesis, requiring it to process the outputs from all other agents, as in Eq. 12. Subordinate agents, however, may only need to consider instructions from the manager, simplifying their context updates. This architecture ensures high coordination and global optimization (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024). However, it introduces a potential performance bottleneck and a single point of failure at the central node (Pan et al., 2025).

##### Decentralized

In a decentralized architecture, there is no central authority. Each agent possesses equal status and makes decisions based on local information and direct peer-to-peer communication (Yang et al., 2025a). Consequently, the context update for every agent typically follows the general form in Eq. 12, where each agent must process the outputs of all its neighbors, or all other agents in a fully connected system. This discussion-like process fosters emergent collaboration and enhances system robustness and fault tolerance, as the failure of one agent does not cripple the entire system (Yang et al., 2025a). However, it may reduce the overall efficiency of resource utilization (Pan et al., 2025).

##### Hierarchical

A hierarchical architecture organizes agents into a structured tree or pyramid, decomposing a complex task into sub-problems at different levels of abstraction. As illustrated in MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024), agents at higher levels are responsible for strategic planning and delegate tasks to lower-level agents, which execute more specific sub-tasks. Information typically flows vertically: instructions pass down from upper to lower levels, and results are passed back up. This structure excels at solving well-defined problems that can be clearly decomposed, promoting efficiency and consistency (Chen et al., 2025b). However, such architectures can be rigid and may stifle the flexibility and creativity of individual agents.

#### 3.4.2. Individual Interaction

The interaction protocol governs how an agent’s goals evolve in response to others, directly influencing the system’s emergent behavior. This introduces a dynamic update to an agent’s goal grig^{r_{i}}, expanding the static goal assumption in the basic reasoning loop (line 6 in Alg. 1). We further categorize these interactions as cooperation, competition, and negotiation. Cooperation emphasizes maximizing collective interests, competition focuses on maximizing individual interests, and negotiation represents a compromise between the two. These three different paradigms can also be further combined to achieve specific reasoning objectives.

##### Cooperation

In cooperation mechanism, the primary objective for agents is to maximize collective interests. A common goal 𝒢\mathcal{G} is established to guide knowledge sharing and collaborative planning (Tran et al., 2025). This goal can be predefined in the system prompt or dynamically formed during different reasoning steps.

At each step, an agent will dynamically update its goal by reflecting on its performance and aligns its individual goal grig^{r_{i}} with the common goal 𝒢\mathcal{G}. The updated goal will further influence the next reasoning step:

| (13) | gri←ar​e​f​l​e​c​tri​(Ckri,gri,𝒢,tri)g^{r_{i}}\leftarrow a_{reflect}^{r_{i}}(C_{k}^{r_{i}},g^{r_{i}},\mathcal{G},t^{r_{i}}) |
| --- | --- |

Therefore, the achievement of individual agentic goals often promotes the goals of other agents and the entire system (Guo et al., 2024).

##### Competition

In competitive interactions, agents pursue their individual goals, which are often in conflict. The objective is to maximize individual benefit, which may involve outperforming or strategically undermining opponents (Chan et al., 2024). An agent must not only advance its own agenda but also infer and counter the intentions of others based on their observable outputs 𝒴k\mathcal{Y}_{k}. The goal update process will therefore become adversarial:

| (14) | gri←ar​e​f​l​e​c​tri​(Ckri,gri,𝒴k,tri),where​𝒴k={ykr1,ykr2,…,ykrn}\begin{gathered}g^{r_{i}}\leftarrow a_{reflect}^{r_{i}}(C_{k}^{r_{i}},g^{r_{i}},\mathcal{Y}_{k},t^{r_{i}}),\text{where}\mathcal{Y}_{k}=\{y_{k}^{r_{1}},y_{k}^{r_{2}},...,y_{k}^{r_{n}}\}\end{gathered} |
| --- | --- |

This dynamic is exemplified by frameworks that use multi-agent debate, such as MAD (Liang et al., 2024a), where agents take on adversarial “debater” roles to challenge assumptions and uncover flaws in reasoning. Such adversarial interactions can significantly improve the robustness and quality of the final output by forcing a thorough exploration of the problem space (Islam et al., 2024).

##### Negotiation

Negotiation is a hybrid interaction that balances cooperation and competition. It enables agents with conflicting interests to reach a mutually acceptable consensus through communication and compromise (Gottweis et al., 2025). During negotiation, agents exchange proposals and iteratively adjust their goals based on both the common objective 𝒢\mathcal{G} and the proposals from others contained in 𝒴k\mathcal{Y}_{k}, as illustrated in Figure 6:

| (15) | gri←ar​e​f​l​e​c​tri​(Ckri,gri,𝒴k,𝒢,tri)w​h​e​r​e​𝒴k={ykr1,ykr2,…,ykrn}\begin{gathered}g^{r_{i}}\leftarrow a_{reflect}^{r_{i}}(C_{k}^{r_{i}},g^{r_{i}},\mathcal{Y}_{k},\mathcal{G},t^{r_{i}})\\ where\mathcal{Y}_{k}=\{y_{k}^{r_{1}},y_{k}^{r_{2}},...,y_{k}^{r_{n}}\}\end{gathered} |
| --- | --- |

This process compels agents to weigh their own objectives against collective constraints and the perspectives of others. For instance, ChatEval (Chan et al., 2024) utilizes a negotiation-like debate among multiple “referee” agents to autonomously evaluate the quality of AI-generated text, reaching a human-aligned judgments. This approach is particularly effective for complex decision-making tasks where there is no single correct answer, but rather a spectrum of acceptable solutions.

### 3.5. Discussion

In this chapter, we introduced a three-level, progressive taxonomy to demonstrate how methods from each level enhance various facets of an agentic framework’s reasoning process. This classification is grounded in a unified formal language and a general reasoning algorithm (Alg. 1). We contend that by combining methods across these levels, the capability boundaries and collaborative patterns of agent systems can be significantly expanded. For instance, each agent member of a multi-agent system (§ 3.4) often optimizes its individual performance through prompt engineering and self-reflection (§ 3.2), while invoking external tools (§ 3.3) to execute specific reasoning steps based on its designated role. In Table 2, we consolidate mainstream general-purpose agentic frameworks, detailing how they integrate methods from the different categories of our taxonomy, along with their proposed inspirations and evaluation datasets.

Furthermore, while our taxonomy provides a comprehensive summary of the logical structures and collaborative patterns at the framework level, we acknowledge that researchers often incorporate optimization techniques like Supervised Fine-Tuning (Gao et al., 2025a) and Reinforcement Learning (Ghasemi et al., 2024) to achieve superior performance (Ke et al., 2025). To maintain a clear focus on the foundational nature of these reasoning frameworks, we exclude these technical details from our classification. In the subsequent chapter, we will further showcase the value of these frameworks by examining their applications in specific scenarios.

Figure 7. The overview of our selected paper of agentic reasoning frameworks across different application scenarios.

\Description

This image is a hierarchical diagram that categorizes the applications of AI agents into four main domains: Scientific Discovery, Healthcare, Software Engineering, and Social and Economic Simulation. Each of these four domains is further broken down into several specific sub-categories. For example, under Scientific Discovery, you can find areas like Math, Astrophysics, Geo-Science, and Biochemistry & Material Science. Next to each sub-category, there is a list of relevant research papers that is selected within our survey.

Building upon the previous chapter’s foundational concepts, this chapter offers a panoramic view of agentic reasoning capabilities across diverse application scenarios. Our primary goal is to systematically compare and contrast the similarities and differences among these frameworks. We also conduct a comprehensive collection of the evaluation metrics, methodologies, and datasets across these domains. We categorize the application scenarios into scientific research, healthcare, software engineering, and social & economic simulations, as illustrated in Fig. 7

### 4.1. Scientific Research

Agent systems are increasingly becoming a cornerstone for automating various stages of scientific inquiry. Through the implementation of well-designed reasoning pipelines, these agents enhance the efficiency of the entire scientific workflow. We systematically review the design of agent frameworks aimed at accelerating research, with a focus on their applications in a range of disciplines including mathematics, astrophysics, geoscience, biochemistry, materials science, as well as general scientific research frameworks.

#### 4.1.1. Math

By leveraging the synergistic combination of their constituent components, agent systems go beyond traditional reasoning methods to achieve remarkable results in specific mathematical domains, including optimization and proof generation.

As an early work, LLM4ED (Du et al., 2024a) utilizes a symbolic library to aid in equation discovery, where the LLM iteratively proposes and refines novel equations based on natural language instructions to outperform purely text-based methods. Subsequent research has gravitated towards multi-agent systems that employ structured collaboration. In the realm of mathematical optimization, Optimus (AhmadiTeshnizi et al., 2024) leverages a multi-agent system to autonomously manage the entire pipeline for mixed-integer linear programming, including task assignment, modeling, and evaluation, while using a central graph to track dependencies for iterative refinement. A similar hierarchical organization is also used in computatioal fluid dynamics (CFD) field by MetaOpenFOAM (Chen et al., 2024f), where role-based agents collaboratively handle simulation design, setup, and review in a iterative closed loop. The concurrent work MetaOpenFOAM 2.0 (Chen et al., 2025g) further enhances robustness by introducing Chain of Thought (CoT) (Wei et al., 2022) and iterative CoT strategies for complex subtask decomposition. This orchestration method also proves effective in OptimAI (Thind et al., 2025), which solves natural language optimization problems by hierarchically decomposing user queries and automating the full cycle of model formulation, coding, and debugging through iterative feedback.

Other related works focus on formal theorem proving. MA-LoT (Wang et al., 2025e) employs multi-agent collaboration to decouple the natural language cognitive task of proof generation from subsequent error analysis. In its framework, one agent generates a complete proof, while another corrects it, establishing a structured interaction between an LLM and the Lean4 verifier guided by a Long CoT. Addressing the challenge of continuous learning, LeanAgent (Kumarappan et al., 2025) optimizes its learning trajectory based on mathematical difficulty and manages evolving knowledge through a dynamic database, enabling stable yet plastic lifelong mathematical learning via progressive training. Besides, Prover Agent (Baba et al., 2025) uses an informal reasoning language model for high-level thinking and a separate formal proof model to execute the theorem-proving steps in Lean. During its reasoning process, the system strategically creates auxiliary intermediate theorems to guide the proof and leverages feedback from Lean to reflect upon and adjust its strategy. Furthermore, MathSensei (Das et al., 2024) emphasizes the auxiliary role of tool invocation in mathematical reasoning. It equips its agent with a comprehensive suite of tools, including a knowledge retriever (powered by an LLM or Bing Web Search), a Python-based program generator and executor, and a symbolic problem solver (Wolfram-Alpha), thereby significantly extending the boundaries of the system’s reasoning capabilities.

#### 4.1.2. Astrophysics

In astrophysics, agent systems are being developed to assist the research process by managing vast, proprietary datasets through automated and scalable collaboration. AstroAgents (Saeedi et al., 2025) generates hypotheses from spectral data. It employs a team of eight specialized agents that work in sequence to interpret the data, perform deep analysis on specific segments, formulate hypotheses, conduct literature searches, evaluate the hypotheses, and propose refinements. Expanding the scope to the entire scientific lifecycle, The AI Cosmologist (Moss, 2025) implements an end-to-end pipeline encompassing ideation, experimental evaluation, and research dissemination. It utilizes dedicated agents for planning, coding, execution, analysis, and synthesis, aiming to automate the complex workflows of data analysis and machine learning research in cosmology and astronomy. Focusing on the cosmological parameter analysis, Laverick et al.’s work (Laverick et al., 2024) is built upon AutoGen framework (Wu et al., 2024) and integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to facilitate the auxiliary analysis of cosmological data.

#### 4.1.3. Geo-science

The integration of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) with agentic reasoning frameworks can significantly enhance a system’s ability to autonomously reason, deduce, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions (Li et al., 2025a). As a pioneering work, Autonomous GIS (Li and Ning, 2023) introduces an agent-based framework for geospatial problem analysis. The system decomposes user requirements into ordered operational steps, constructs a flowchart, and generates Python code to sequentially execute tasks such as data loading, spatial joins, statistical analysis, and plotting to produce the final output. Concurrent works have specialized in particular aspects of the workflow. Ning et al. (Ning et al., 2025) enhances the reasoning process by focusing on data retrieval. It performs autonomous data discovery based on task understanding and a data-source manual, while generating Python retrieval code via in-context learning that is iteratively executed, debugged, and refined by the framework. Moreover, Pantiukhin et al. (Pantiukhin et al., 2025) leverages a centralized Multi-Agent System and a suite of earth science tools for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Crucially, it incorporates a reflection module to contemplate evaluation outcomes and drive iterative improvements to its plan. Besides, GeoLLM-Squad (Lee et al., 2025b) targets on Remote Sensing (RS) workflows. Built upon the AutoGen (Wu et al., 2024) and GeoLLM-Engine (Singh et al., 2024a) frameworks, it modularizes RS applications by decomposing complex tasks and assigning them to specialized sub-agents, covering areas such as urban monitoring, forestry conservation, climate analysis, and agricultural research.

Further research has focused on improving the quality and scope of agent-based geospatial analysis. To mitigate subjective bias in domain-specific question answering, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2024c) utilizes RAG and online search to comprehensively gather relevant information. The system then employs a CoT (Wei et al., 2022) process to integrate and reflect upon this information, ensuring reliable geospatial analysis. Pushing the boundaries of task complexity, GeoAgent (Huang et al., 2024a) builds upon RAG by incorporating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to plan and execute multi-step analyses. Starting from a natural language description, it iteratively generates, runs, and debugs multi-step code. GeoAgent (Huang et al., 2024a) also introduced the Geocode Benchmark, a comprehensive suite of single and multi-turn tasks involving data acquisition, analysis, and visualization to evaluate agents in diverse geospatial contexts. Venturing into multi-modal understanding, GeoMap-Agent (Huang et al., 2025a) pioneers the use of a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to interpret geological maps. It performs hierarchical information extraction to segment the map and identify salient elements. This is followed by retrieving domain knowledge from an expert database, which is integrated into an enhanced prompt to enable precise question answering. GeoMap-Agent (Huang et al., 2025a) also introduce GeoMap-Bench, the first benchmark designed to assess the geological map understanding capabilities of MLLMs across a full spectrum of skills, including extraction, referring, localization, reasoning, and analysis.

#### 4.1.4. Biochemistry and Material Science

The advent of deep learning has significantly enhanced research productivity across the life sciences (Abramson et al., 2024), and the rise of agentic systems is now further pushing the boundaries of workflow automation. In this section, we survey the application of agentic reasoning in this domain, which we categorize into five primary areas: (1) drug discovery and design, (2) genetic and biological experiment design, (3) chemical synthesis, (4) material science, and (5) research automation. These work across different sub-scenarios cover a wide range of targets, thus their evaluation strategies are very different. As illustrated in Table 3, we summarize their evaluation strategies in metrics level, benchmark or dataset level, and case study methods, respectively. Furthermore, as several applications in biochemistry have direct extensions to clinical practice, they will be discussed in greater detail in Section § 4.2.

##### Drug Discovery

In drug discovery and design, agentic systems must balance user requirements with scientific principles to achieve precise molecular engineering. Several works have explored centralized or single-agent architectures to this end. ChatDrug (Liu et al., 2024c) integrates retrieval tools to fetch similar molecules with desired attributes from knowledge bases, translating editing tasks into structured instructions to contextualize the reasoning process. It further leverages a dialogue module to iteratively refine molecules based on user feedback. Similarly, LIDDiA (Averly et al., 2025) employs a four-component architecture – reasoner, executor, evaluator, and memory – to guide molecular design, extensively using tool calls to simulate molecular docking, predict properties, and optimize structures according to personalized specifications. Moreover, DrugAgent (Inoue et al., 2025) simulates a collaborative research team using CoT (Wei et al., 2022) and ReAct paradigms (Yao et al., 2023) to predict Drug-Target Interactions (DTI). It can forecast DTI scores, compute interaction metrics, search domain knowledge, and generate a final prediction with a detailed explanation.

Other frameworks utilize hierarchical Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) to decompose the complex drug discovery pipeline. PharmAgents (Gao et al., 2025b) divides the process into four stages: target discovery, lead identification and optimization, and preclinical evaluation. Each stage is managed by dedicated agents equipped with distinct tools, which collaborate via structured knowledge exchange and self-improve by reflecting on past experiences. CLADD (Lee et al., 2025a) also adopts a hierarchical structure for discovery and question-answering, combining it with a RAG approach. It breaks down reasoning into planning, knowledge graph querying, molecular understanding, and prediction, and can dynamically select tools based on a query molecule’s structural similarity to known drugs in a knowledge graph. Specifically focusing on the human-agent interface, ChatChemTS (Ishida et al., 2025) enables users to design new molecules by automatically constructing a reward function for specified properties purely through natural language interaction.

##### Genomics and Biological Experiment Design

Figure 8. A summarization of pipeline proposed by BioDiscovery-Agent (Roohani et al., 2025), base on our proposed taxonomy. Such framework could allows a iterative experimental design with dynamic context update. Image is edited from (Roohani et al., 2025).

\Description

This image is a flowchart that outlines the pipeline of a BioDiscovery-Agent, based on an iterative experimental design with dynamic context updates.

In genomics and biological experiment design, agentic systems are tasked with analyzing, decomposing, and implementing user requirements, thereby assisting researchers to handle complex experimental workflows. As a representative work, BioDiscovery-Agent (Roohani et al., 2025) iteratively designs gene perturbation experiments by integrating prior results and knowledge into its reasoning context, as illustrated in Fig. 8. In each cycle, it constructs prompts to guide the design of small-batch experiments, prioritizing genes likely to produce significant phenotypic effects. This process involves invoking other agents for critical evaluation, literature searches, and data analysis to enable efficient identification of gene functions. Similarly, CRISPR-GPT (Qu et al., 2025) offers multiple interaction modes, decomposes gene editing experiments into manageable steps for in-context learning, and integrates external tools to achieve automation.

Table 3. An overview of the evaluation strategies of agentic reasoning frameworks in Biochemistry and Material Science. We summarize them from three levels. In metrics level, the specific response of the framework is directly evaluated. Benchmark and Dataset level further utilizes domain-specific data and standard to evaluate the responses. In case study, the framework will be evaluated through several real-world tasks, generally the ground truth is clear.

Other approaches focus on model customization and workflow robustness. Bio-Agents (Mehandru et al., 2025) is built upon a small language model (SLM) fine-tuned on bioinformatics data and enhanced with RAG, enabling personalized operations and the analysis of local or proprietary data. AutoBA (Zhou et al., 2024b) concentrates on automating multi-omics analysis, capable of self-designing the analytical process in response to changes in input data and enhancing system robustness through automated code repair. To simplify bioinformatics workflows, BioMaster (Su et al., 2025b) uses a Multi-Agent System (MAS) for task decomposition, execution, and validation. It employs RAG to dynamically retrieve domain-specific knowledge and introduces input-output validation to improve adaptability and stability when handling new tools and niche analyses.

##### Chemical Synthesis and Design

In chemical synthesis, early agentic systems focused on optimizing reaction conditions and automating complex workflows. Chemist-X (Chen et al., 2023) designed a multi-stage reasoning system to optimize reaction conditions. It first retrieved reaction conditions from a database via hierarchical matching, then used a CAD tool to recommend yield-improving conditions, and finally translated these recommendations into validated experimental operations. Similarly, Ruan et al. (Ruan et al., 2024) decomposes chemical synthesis development into six sub-stages: literature search, experimental design, hardware execution, spectral analysis, product separation, and result interpretation. Each stage is executed by a dedicated agent, sequentially accomplishing the entire workflow. Moreover, ChemCrow (Bran et al., 2023) incorporated 18 expert-designed chemistry tools, demonstrating their efficacy by successfully automating the design of an organic catalyst synthesis.

Other systems tackle more specialized or abstract challenges within chemistry. El Agente Q (Zou et al., 2025) dynamically generates and executes quantum chemistry workflows from natural language prompts, leveraging a hierarchical multi-agent memory framework for task decomposition, adaptive tool selection, and autonomous post-analysis. Targeting the upstream process of scientific inquiry, MOOSE-Chem (Yang et al., 2025b) focuses on autonomous chemical hypothesis discovery. It formalizes this process by decomposing a base hypothesis into a research context and a set of “inspirations”, which then guide the sub-tasks of retrieving, combining, and ranking new hypotheses. Stewart et al. (Stewart and Buehler, 2025) sequentially identifies engineering goals, generates a large pool of candidate molecules through rational steps and knowledge extraction, and then analyzes them by structure and charge distribution to achieve molecular optimization.

##### Material Science

As one of the early works, ChatMoF (Kang and Kim, 2024) constructed a system for predicting and generating Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). It can autonomously select and invoke specialized tool-kits based on user requirements, making decisions iteratively based on tool outputs and internal evaluations. This is achieved through four distinct functional agent components responsible for MOF database searching, internet searching, performance prediction, and material generation. Concurrently, LLaMP (Chiang et al., 2025) combines a hierarchical ReAct framework (Yao et al., 2023) with a multi-modal, retrieval-augmented one to dynamically and recursively interact with computational and experimental data on the Materials Project (MP) database, running atomic simulations via a high-throughput workflow interface. Furthermore, AtomAgents (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2025a) proposes a physics-aware approach to alloy design. Its multi-agent system autonomously implements the entire material design pipeline – from knowledge retrieval and multi-modal data integration to physics-based simulation and cross-modal comprehensive result analysis.

##### Biochemical Automated Research

Beyond optimizing for specialized domains, several works have proposed systematic designs from the broader perspective of automating biochemical research. These systems often focus on sophisticated agent orchestration and interaction. For instance, ProtAgents (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2024) is a task-centric multi-agent system that decomposes the protein design and analysis process into multiple stages. It employs a predefined chat manager as a central hub to dynamically select appropriate agents and manage their communication. Based on distinct role and tool assignments, these agents collaborate to propose protein designs, execute physical simulations, predict structures, and iteratively reflect upon, evaluate, and refine the designs. Similarly, Toursynbio-search (Liu et al., 2024a) implements a user-driven research system where each specialized agent has an independent keyword list. It uses fuzzy matching against the classified user intent to select the right agent, then initiates a validation process, generating an interactive page for user verification and supplementation when parameters are ambiguous.

Other systems introduce specific mechanisms to improve the research workflow. BioResearcher (Luo et al., 2025) decomposes research tasks (retrieval, planning, analysis) and assigns them within a hierarchical agent architecture. Crucially, it introduces a reviewer agent to ensure quality control throughout the process and iteratively optimizes the research plan via internal evaluation. Focusing on tool use, CACTUS (McNaughton et al., 2024) utilizes the LangChain architecture for sequential problem analysis, tool review, and selection. This reasoning cycle repeats until the problem is solved, allowing the system to learn the characteristics and applicability of different tools through iteration. ChemHTS (Li et al., 2025b) further refines tool-calling strategy with a hierarchical tool stack. It first conducts a “self-stacking warm-up” phase to explore tool capabilities and limitations, then recursively combines tools to find the optimal calling path, using selective information transfer and tool encapsulation to keep the focus on the primary task.

#### 4.1.5. General Research

The problem-solving capabilities of agentic frameworks can be generalized from specialized, domain-specific tasks to broader research inquiries. These systems are designed to operate from an initial prompt to the final deliverable of a detailed research report. Here we classify these scenarios into literature survey, end-to-end research automation, research collaboration and refinement. Table 4 summarize different metrics and datasets used in each selected work, with their specific focus about general research. We also conclude the work that use case study or subjective methods to evaluate their work.

Table 4. An Overview of Evaluation Strategies of Agentic Frameworks in General Research. We summarize them from four levels. In metrics level, the output literature from framework is directly evaluated. Benchmark and Dataset level further provides and filters several literature with high quality and diverse themes. In case study, the framework will be used to complete a real-world research task, and generally evaluated by domain-specific professionals. LLM-as-a-judge or human evaluation tend to evaluate the output literature of framework from several subjective metrics.

##### Literature Survey

Automating literature surveys requires systems to process and orchestrate vast amounts of domain literature to generate comprehensive and coherent reviews. Autosurvey (Wang et al., 2024a) first retrieves relevant literature via semantic search and generates a preliminary outline. It then employs multiple agents to concurrently draft each section, retrieving additional literature to produce text with accurate citations. After drafting, the system integrates and refines the content, using multi-LLM-as-judge setup to score the survey’s quality and coverage for iterative improvement. Similarly, SurveyX (Liang et al., 2025) automates this process in two phases: a preparation phase that uses an attribute tree structure to acquire and preprocess literature, and a generation phase that performs both coarse and fine-grained content creation from an initial plan. RAG is leveraged to ensure citation accuracy during rewriting and to support multi-media content generation. Besides, Surveyforge (Yan et al., 2025) combines a library of human-written outlines with domain-specific papers to generate a new outline via in-context learning. It introduces a memory-driven framework with multi-layer sub-query and retrieval memories to refine the search process, followed by filtering and reconstruction stages for content integration and parallel text generation. This work also contributes Surveybench, a benchmark for quantitatively evaluating survey quality across multiple dimensions.

##### End-to-End Research Automation

Moving beyond knowledge synthesis, end-to-end research automation aims to emulate the entire scientific lifecycle for a given topic, often by mimicking real-world research workflows. As a representative work, Agent Laboratory (Schmidgall et al., 2025) actualizes a user’s research idea through a multi-stage, hierarchical architecture covering literature retrieval, experimental planning, code generation, result analysis, and report writing, integrating human feedback at each stage for quality assurance. Many similar works decompose the research process to achieve automation. The AI Scientist (Lu et al., 2024) decompose scientific discovery into five stages (ideation, experiment design, execution, paper writing, and peer review), guiding agents with structured instructions. AI Scientist-v2 (Yamada et al., 2025) further introduces an experimental parameter space and a tree-search algorithm to optimize the research process, incorporating a vision-language model (VLM) to provide feedback on generated figures and text. Notably, papers generated by this system have passed peer review at ICLR workshop444 https://github.com/SakanaAI/AI-Scientist-ICLR2025-Workshop-Experiment/. Moreover, AI-Reseracher (Tang et al., 2025b) adopt a four-stage decomposition of the research pipeline from literature review, hypothesis generation, algorithm implementation to manuscript writing. AI-Reseracher (Tang et al., 2025b) also propose Scientist-Bench, which comprises recent papers spanning diverse AI research areas and includes both guided-innovation and open-ended exploration tasks. Moreover, Robin (Ghareeb et al., 2025) facilitates semi-autonomous discovery by progressing through four stages: hypothesis generation, experimental design, result interpretation, and hypothesis updating. Besides, Papercoder (Seo et al., 2025) automates the reproduction of code from machine learning papers. It uses three dedicated agents for a three-stage process: a planning stage to create a high-level roadmap, an analysis stage to interpret specific implementation details, and a generation stage to produce modular, dependency-aware code.

##### Research Collaboration and Refinement

There are some emergent research focuses on introducing specific mechanisms for collaboration and refinement to enhance the quality, creativity, and efficiency of automated science. A significant direction is improving idea and hypothesis generation through multi-agent interaction. ResearchAgent (Baek et al., 2025) iteratively refines research ideas by integrating core papers, their citation network, and feedback from a panel of “reviewer agents” to mimic peer review and foster innovation. Similarly, VirSci (Su et al., 2025a) uses multi-agent dialogue – spanning collaborator selection, topic discussion, and novelty assessment – to generate ideas, while AI co-scientist (Gottweis et al., 2025) employs a hierarchical agent team for critical debate to propose, critique, and refine hypotheses. Notably, this system also presents a fully-automated end-to-end research abilities based on the widely debate and iteratively refinement between agent with different roles.

Another key direction is the refinement of the research process and agent capabilities. CycleResearcher (Weng et al., 2025) proposes an iterative training framework that simulates the “research-review-improve” academic closed loop to enhance generated paper quality, contributing two large datasets for this purpose. Furthermore, SciAgents (Ghafarollahi and Buehler, 2025b) leverages an ontology knowledge graph for structured reasoning, while Scimaster (Chai et al., 2025a) uses a decentralized, stacked workflow to scale reasoning depth and breadth. At the ecosystem level, Agentrxiv (Schmidgall and Moor, 2025) constructs a scientific ecosystem where multiple Agent Laboratories (Schmidgall et al., 2025) can collaborate asynchronously. By using a centralized preprint server, independent agent teams can upload, share, and retrieve research, forming a dynamic knowledge commons that enables cumulative, collaborative scientific discovery.

### 4.2. Healthcare

The advent of powerful foundational Large Language Models is reshaping the landscape of healthcare by empowering agentic systems with new capabilities. This transformation facilitates a critical shift from reactive, predictive functions to proactive, interactive engagement in clinical workflows. These advanced agents are increasingly leveraged to resolve chronic issues surrounding clinical efficiency, diagnostic precision, and the quality of patient care. As summarized in Table 5, a wide range of evaluation datasets as well as methods are used to evaluate these framework. Accordingly, we survey these works through diagnostic assistance, clinical management, and environmental simulation.

#### 4.2.1. Diagnosis Assistance

To augment diagnostic capabilities, one primary research focus involves creating multi-agent dialogue frameworks that deconstruct the complex diagnostic process into manageable, collaborative phases. As an early work, MedAgents (Tang et al., 2024) established a role-playing environment where agents representing different medical experts achieve a consensus through independent analysis and iterative discussion. Concurrently, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2025a) designed a virtual medical team that includes a physician, a patient, and an examiner in order to model the consultation flow across inquiry, examination, and diagnosis, guided by a hierarchical action set for dynamic responses. Similarly, Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2025e) employed an admin agent for user information, doctor agents for diagnosis via dialogue, and a supervisor agent to ensure diagnostic consistency. Besides, RareAgents (Chen et al., 2024b) focuses on rare diseases, featuring a primary physician agent that collaborates with multiple specialist agents over several rounds of discussion, integrating dynamic long-term memory and medical tools for personalized diagnostics.

Table 5. An Overview of Evaluation Strategies of Agentic Frameworks in Healthcare. We summarize them from four levels. In benchmark and dataset Level, the framework is evaluate through domain-specific data with specific metrics; System level will evaluate the framework as a whole, with specific techniques; In environmental level, the framework is evaluated within a simulated healthcare environment, while the case study tend to evaluate the system through real-world cases, with ground truth provided.

Beyond simulating dialogue, other frameworks enhance diagnostic reasoning by integrating external knowledge bases and data-driven debate mechanisms. KG4Diagnosis (Zuo et al., 2025) utilizes a hierarchical multi-agent structure where a general practitioner agent first conducts triage before coordinating with specialist agents who perform in-depth diagnosis leveraging a knowledge graph. This approach features an end-to-end pipeline for semantic knowledge extraction and human-guided reasoning, therefore improving system extensibility. MD2GPS (Zhou et al., 2025a) introduces a multi-agent debate system driven by both existing literature and patient data to diagnose Mendelian diseases effectively.

A parallel research direction empowers agents with tools for autonomous data analysis and evidence synthesis, transitioning them from communicators to actors. AI-HOPE (Yang and Velazquez-Villarreal, 2025) can interpret natural language commands into executable code, enabling it to autonomously analyze locally stored data for precision medicine research through tasks like association studies and survival analysis. Moreover, TxAgent (Gao et al., 2025c) introduces ToolUniverse, a comprehensive suite of 211 specialized medical tools. By invoking these tools, the agent can retrieve and synthesize evidence from multiple sources, consider drug interactions and patient history, and iteratively refine treatment recommendations.

Addressing the heterogeneous nature of real-world medical data, recent efforts have focused on developing multi-modal diagnostic agents. Mmedagent (Li et al., 2024d) constructs a system where a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) acts as a planner, orchestrating a four-step process of user input interpretation, action planning, tool execution, and result aggregation, enhancing its tool-use proficiency via in-context learning. Similarly, MedAgent-Pro (Wang et al., 2025f) adopts a hierarchical agentic workflow. It first retrieves clinical guidelines using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to formulate a diagnostic plan. It then employs sequential tool calls to analyze the patient’s multi-modal data, generating a final report that includes diagnostic evidence.

#### 4.2.2. Clinical Management and Automation

Recently, in order to efficiently manage and analyze complex medical information, a growing number of research are focusing on adapting general-purpose agentic management and automation systems. For instance, ClinicalAgent (Yue et al., 2024) utilizes a hierarchical multi-agent architecture to predict clinical trial outcomes, assessing drug efficacy, safety, and patient recruitment feasibility based on external data sources and predictive models. Other systems target the automation of healthcare services; Medaide (Wei et al., 2024b), performs query rewriting via RAG and uses contextual encoding to identify fine-grained user intents. This process activates relevant agents to collaborate based on role assignments, delivering personalized diagnostic suggestions and department recommendations. Furthermore, Pandy et al. (Pandey et al., 2024) explores the justification of prior authorizations by first reasoning over clinical guidelines and then employing a two-stage collaborative framework to decompose the problem into solvable sub-tasks for each agent.

However, directly implementing multi-agent collaboration can lead to challenges such as incompatible medical information flows and low component efficiency (Bedi et al., 2025). To enhance adaptability and dynamism, MDAgents (Kim et al., 2024b) introduces a moderator agent that dynamically assembles appropriate multi-agent structures based on the complexity of the medical problem. This framework can configure specialized teams, such as a Primary Care Clinician, a Multidisciplinary Team, or an Integrated Care Team, and selectively employs reflection, iterative optimization, and collaborative methods to improve response accuracy. In order to further address limitations like potential single points of failure, TAO (Kim et al., 2025b) proposes a tiered agentic operator framework to bolster system security and reliability. In this hierarchical structure, an “Agent Recruiter” selects medical agents based on safety benchmarks, while an “Agent Router” assesses and assigns them to different security tiers. The recruited agents then engage in hierarchical cooperation under strict safety protocols, enabling effective end-to-end supervision, which also incorporates possibilities for human oversight. This trend towards structured and secure workflows is underscored by the push for systems that can navigate the complexities of sensitive data and automated decisions while adhering to regulatory standards (Neupane et al., 2025).

#### 4.2.3. Environmental Simulation

Figure 9. Pipeline of AIME (Tu et al., 2025). The framework is built upon two self-play loops. a) Inner Loop: a doctor agent continuously optimize its behavior based on real-time feedback from a Critic module during simulated dialogues. b) Outer Loop: the optimized simulated dialogues and other data will be gathered to improve (fine-tune) the Reasoning System, using an evaluation-feedback process to drive the model’s continuous improvement. For real-time user interaction (reasoning process shown on the right), the system uses multi-step CoT reasoning and conversational context to ensure each output is accurate and well-grounded. Image is edited from Tu et al. (Tu et al., 2025)

\Description

This image presents the pipeline of AIME, a framework built upon two self-play loops. The Inner Loop shows a “Doctor Agent” engaging in a simulated dialogue with a “Patient Agent”, with a Moderator and a Critic providing real-time feedback to optimize the agent’s behavior. The Outer Loop takes the optimized simulated dialogues and other data from the Inner Loop to improve a main Reasoning System through a continuous evaluation-feedback process. The diagram also illustrates how this system interacts with a real patient, using multi-step reasoning and conversational context to generate accurate and well-grounded outputs. This setup allows the system to continuously learn and improve its performance on medical tasks.

Given that the healthcare domain is characterized by heterogeneous data which could be hard to collect, a significant line of research focuses on simulating realistic medical environments to enable agents to continuously optimize their performance through interactive learning. As a representative work, AIME (Tu et al., 2025) simulates a diagnostic environment with physician, patient, and referee roles. By leveraging role-playing and CoT (Wei et al., 2022) strategies, it allows an agent to self-tune its diagnostic capabilities using dialogue data within an automated feedback loop, as illustrated in Fig. 9.

Moreover, AgentClinic (Schmidgall et al., 2024) constructs a more complex multi-modal clinical simulation, focusing on patient interaction, data collection with incomplete information, and medical tool usage. The paradigm takes a major leap forward with Agent Hospital (Li et al., 2024c), which creates a simulated hospital where agents can evolve autonomously based on task resolution, learning from both successful treatments and failed cases without reliance on manually annotated data.

Beyond agent training, these simulated environments also serve as sophisticated testbeds for evaluation and as platforms for medical education. For instance, AI Hospital (Fan et al., 2025) establishes a dynamic evaluation environment by simulating four distinct roles (physician, patient, inspector, and director) and introduces the corresponding MVME benchmark. Its decentralized, role-based setup allows for the assessment of an agent’s capabilities in symptom collection, examination recommendation, diagnosis, and dispute resolution. As for medical education, Medco (Wei et al., 2024a) builds a collaborative learning system by simulating multi-disciplinary scenarios where student agents can interact with patient agents, expert physicians, and radiologists to proactively gather information and refine their diagnostic decisions. Besides, MedAgentSim (Almansoori et al., 2025) presents a comprehensive simulation that requires agents to engage in multi-round, multi-modal interactions. It incorporates a self-improvement mechanism based on historical context and, notably, supports direct human interaction with the agents within the simulated environment.

### 4.3. Software Engineering

In contrast to Large Language Models specialized in code generation, agentic systems leverage a rich ecosystem of external tools to address a broader spectrum of software engineering tasks. This subsection examines the application of these agents in three key areas: code generation and testing, program repair, and full-lifecycle software development.

#### 4.3.1. Code Generation and Testing

In the domain of code generation and testing, agentic systems significantly amplify the capabilities of LLMs beyond simple fine-tuning. These systems introduce structured collaboration and external tools, enhancing both the efficiency and reliability of code generation. Table. 6 demonstrates the performance of the selected agentic coding frameworks on popular benchmarks. A primary approach involves decomposing the coding process using multi-agent frameworks that emulate human programmer workflows. Mapcoder (Islam et al., 2024) decouples code generation into four collaborating LLM agents for retrieval, planning, coding, and debugging. The framework features a dynamic agent traversal model that adapts based on confidence scores from the planning phase, alongside plan-guided debugging and autonomous retrieval. Similarly, Almorsi et al. (Almorsi et al., 2024) implements a deliberately structured and fine-grained approach, utilizing LLMs as fuzzy searchers and approximate information retrievers. This multi-agent system effectively compensates for the inherent limitations of LLMs in long-sequence reasoning and long-context understanding. Moreover, Agentcoder (Huang et al., 2023b) pioneers a test-driven development (TDD) approach. It employs three distinct agents responsible for initial code generation, test case creation, and test execution with feedback. This test-driven iterative refinement loop enables the generation of higher-quality code with more efficient token usage.

Another major focuses is augmenting LLMs with external tools to improve code quality and mitigate hallucination. CoCoST (He et al., 2024) introduces a framework where a task planner decomposes complex problems, an online search module acquires external knowledge, and a code generator iterates with a correctness tester to fix latent bugs. Moreover, CodeAgent (Zhang et al., 2024e) integrates five distinct programming tools for repository-level code generation. Through rule-based tool usage, the system interacts with various software artifacts, iteratively performing information retrieval, code symbol navigation, and code testing. The authors also introduced CodeBench, a comprehensive benchmark for repository-level code generation, featuring code repositories across multiple domains.

#### 4.3.2. Program Repair

Complementary to code generation, automated program repair (APR) is another cornerstone of Agent System in software engineering. During the multi-step reasoning process, they could systematically understanding code, localizing faults, generating patches, and validating fixes, often through sophisticated tool use and collaborative strategies. Table 7 shows the performance of selected APR agentic frameworks on popular software repair benchmarks.

A common strategy is to decompose the complex repair process into a structured workflow. RepairAgent (Bouzenia et al., 2025) formalizes this into four stages: defect information collection, fault localization, patch generation, and validation, using a state machine to dynamically select tools and adapt its strategy. Similarly, AgentFL (Qin et al., 2024b) employs a multi-agent system to infer defect causes, search for relevant context using program instrumentation, and validate fixes, leveraging multi-turn dialogue to manage context length. Inventor (Wang et al., 2024e) introduced an interactive “repair chain” concept, where a “code teacher” agent analyzes compiler errors to generate natural language suggestions, guiding a “code learner” agent in an iterative repair process. Agentless (Xia et al., 2024) simplifies the process into three phases – locate, fix, and validate – using a hierarchical strategy that combines semantic understanding with code embedding retrieval to rapidly identify suspicious code snippets.

A critical sub-task within this workflow is precise fault localization. Several specialized agents have been developed for this purpose. OrcaLoca (Yu et al., 2025) focuses on efficient localization by using dynamic priority scheduling and relevance scoring to prioritize actions, along with distance-aware context pruning to filter irrelevant code. LocAgent (Chen et al., 2025d) introduces a novel graph-based approach, parsing the codebase into a directed heterogeneous graph that captures structural dependencies, enabling an LLM agent to perform effective multi-hop reasoning for entity localization. Meanwhile, VulDebugger (Liu et al., 2025d) utilizes both static and dynamic program analysis, continuously comparing the actual program state (observed via a debugger) with the expected state (inferred from constraints) to identify and rectify errors.

Building on these principles, recent frameworks aim to provide end-to-end solutions for real-world scenarios like resolving GitHub issues. MAGIS (Tao et al., 2024) employs a centralized architecture with four agents orchestrated by a central controller to manage task decomposition, file retrieval, code modification, and review. Autocoderover (Zhang et al., 2024i) further tackles GitHub issues by integrating structured code search with spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL) to pinpoint buggy methods. It then iteratively retrieves context via API calls and refines the issue description to synthesize a patch, demonstrating a robust solution in a practical setting. Besides, Rondon et al. (Rondon et al., 2025) explored the viability of agent-based program repair in an enterprise environment, contributing a valuable dataset of both human and machine reported bugs and offering insights into real-world applicability.

#### 4.3.3. Full-cycle Development

Beyond discrete tasks like generation and repair, agentic systems are increasingly engineered to automate the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC), from initial requirements analysis to final testing and documentation. These systems often simulate human software teams and adopt established development methodologies. Early explorations constructed virtual teams composed of agents with distinct roles. Dong et al. (Dong et al., 2024) organize a analyst, a coder, and a tester agents managed by a waterfall model, communicating via a shared blackboard. Moreover, CHatdev (Qian et al., 2024) formalizes the process into design, coding, and testing phases, enabling role-specific agents to collaborate through natural language. It introduces a chat chain for task refinement and a communicative de-hallucination mechanism to ensure requirement clarity before coding. A significant advancement came with MetaGPT (Hong et al., 2024), which mimics the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of human software companies. By assigning roles and enforcing structured workflows, MetaGPT facilitates hierarchical multi-agent collaboration across the full development pipeline, from requirements analysis to system design and testing, ensuring accurate information flow and reducing communication overhead.

Furthermore, RepoAgent (Luo et al., 2024) specializes in automated code documentation. It analyzes project-level hierarchy and code dependencies to enrich LLM prompts and integrates with Git to maintain consistency between code and documentation in real-time. Similarly, DocAgent (Yang et al., 2025c) employs a multi-agent team – comprising a reader, searcher, writer, validator, and coordinator, and uses topological code processing to automate the generation of comprehensive software documentation .

A more fundamental innovation focus on how could agents interact with their developing environment. SWE-Agent (Yang et al., 2024a) pioneers an Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) that allows an agent to perform operations directly on a code repository, such as creating and editing files, navigating the filesystem, and executing test suites. Concurrently, Openhands (Wang et al., 2025b) imitates human developer interactions by providing agents with a sandboxed environment where they can write code, use a command-line interface, browse the web, and coordinate complex tasks, granting them a higher degree of autonomy. Besides, at the level of software system, MAAD (Zhang et al., 2025c) tackles the complex process of software architecture design by creating a multi-agent system that learns from existing design knowledge, academic literature, and expert experience to generate and optimize architectures. Meanwhile SyncMind (Guo et al., 2025a) identifies and addresses core challenges within these systems, such as the “belief inconsistency” problem in collaborative software engineering, and proposes SyncBench benchmarks to validate the solutions.

### 4.4. Social and Economic Simulation

Apart from previous setions, the advent and rapid advancement of Large Language Models have also established a revolutionary paradigm for simulating social and economic behaviors. LLM-based agents, endowed with sophisticated, human-like capacities for reasoning, perception, and action, serve as the foundational elements of this new approach. Ranging from single-agent decision-making models to complex multi-agent systems, these frameworks are designed to construct and simulate critical socioeconomic dynamics at various scales. Consequently, they provide a powerful and versatile methodology for researchers to explore complex phenomena within the social and economic sciences.

#### 4.4.1. Social Simulation

Figure 10. The fundamental paradigm for social simulation based on an Agentic Reasoning Framework. In this framework, each Individual is powered by LLM-based Agent. a) Individual (purple at the middle): Each agent possesses its unique initial profile, personal goal, available tools, and a dynamically updated personal context, engaging in dynamic learning and decision-making based on continuous context updates. b) Individual with Others (blue at the left): Individual continuously updates its cognition, goals, and context by observing the behaviors of other individuals and reflecting on the Individual Events that arise from interactions. c) Individual with Environments (green at the right): When individual executes an action in the Public Action Space, it can trigger Public Events or leave messages in the Message Pool. Correspondingly, the environment feeds these changes back to the agent via a Status Update, thus forming a complete interaction loop that influences its subsequent decisions. In summary, through the dual loops of social and environmental interaction, each agent maintains the independence of its context and goals, executes distinct asynchronous social behaviors, and thereby contributes to the emergence of complex and realistic social dynamics at the group level.

\Description

This image presents the fundamental paradigm for social simulation using an Agentic Reasoning Framework. The diagram illustrates a central Individual agent with a profile, personal goals, and tools, which interacts with both Other Individuals and Environments.

LLM-based social simulation leverages the autonomy of agents to model a wide spectrum of emergent social behaviors. They could interact with different individuals which are also powered by LLMs, or dynamically act, learn and improve themselves from the simulated environments, as demonstrated in Fig. 10, Early and influential research in this area often operates within text-based sandbox environments, where agents are assigned specific profiles and action spaces to drive interaction. One of the pioneer work is Generative Agents (Park et al., 2023), which established this paradigm by creating an interactive sandbox with 25 agents, each possessing the capacity to observe, plan, and reflect, thus exhibiting distinct personalities. This setup allowed for the qualitative assessment of individual and collective behaviors through natural language interaction. Following this paradigms, subsequent studies have explored critical social dynamics. For instance, MetaAgents (Li et al., 2023c) assessed coordination skills in a simulated job fair, while GOVSIM (Piatti et al., 2024) investigated whether agents could negotiate sustainable equilibria in a commons dilemma. Other research has used similar frameworks to study the formation of information cocoons, conformity (Wang et al., 2025h), and voting behaviors in election scenarios (Zhang et al., 2024f).

Moreover, the focus expanded from specific simulations to the development of generalizable platforms and the modeling of online interactions. To enhance reusability and extensibility, frameworks like GenSim (Tang et al., 2025a) and Sotopia-S4 (Zhou et al., 2025b) were introduced. These platforms provide configurable systems where researchers can define roles, contextual information, and action spaces to customize diverse multi-agent scenarios and test hypotheses with tailored evaluation metrics. Besides, research began to address the complexities of online social networks. BASES (Ren et al., 2024) modeled the emergent web search behaviors of diverse user profiles, while Mou et al. (Mou et al., 2024) simulated the propagation of influence in social movements by differentiating between core agent-driven users and peripheral users. The challenge of simulating malicious online environments was tackled by BotSim (Qiao et al., 2025), which created a mixed network of agents and human users. Similarly, Y-Social (Rossetti et al., 2024) employed digital twin technology to replicate the dynamics of user interactions on social media platforms.

A primary challenge in social simulation is achieving realism at a large scale, while Recent systems have made solid progress in this direction. Oasis (Yang et al., 2024c) implements large-scale user simulation by integrating dynamic context updates and an interest-based recommendation system modeled after real-world platforms. SocioVerse (Zhang et al., 2025d) further enhances scalability by introducing and restructuring real-world information to create distinct contextual environments that drive divergent individual behaviors. In addition, S3 (Gao et al., 2023a) simplifies the simulation of large-scale social networks by employing group agents. It follows a hierarchical architecture where each group agent represents a demographic population rather than a single individual. By assigning characteristics, emotions, and attitudes based on role distributions, the system can simulate macro-level network interactions, offering a computationally efficient abstraction for massive-scale social dynamics. As a conclusion, Table. 8 summarize these simulation work with their different simulation focus, data source and scale.

#### 4.4.2. Economic Perception and Simulation

Agentic frameworks are increasingly being leveraged to perceive, analyze, and simulate complex economic markets, a domain with immense real-world value (Cao et al., 2025). The evolution of these frameworks can be understood through three advancing frontiers: enhancing agent-native cognitive abilities, optimizing collaborative structures, and creating large-scale market simulations.

Initially, efforts focused on equipping individual agents with sophisticated cognitive modules. Early work like Finmem (Yu et al., 2024a) established a foundational agent system with analysis, memory, and decision modules, where the memory component utilized reflection and interactive learning to process historical context. Similarly, EconAgent (Li et al., 2024b) situated an LLM-based agent within a simulated macroeconomic environment, employing perception, memory, and reflection modules to analyze its behavior. This focus on reflection as a core cognitive faculty was further advanced by subsequent systems. Finvision (Fatemi and Hu, 2024) places systematic reflection at its center, using a multi-agent system to analyze historical trading signals and generate feedback to improve future decisions. More recently, Zhang et al. (Zhang et al., 2024j) introduced a sophisticated two-level reflection module. This module processes multimodal market information to establish distinct causal links between market data and price movements, while also reflecting on historical trading performance. Its memory system separately stores parsed market information and the insights from both levels of reflection to inform decision-making.

Building upon individual agent capabilities, another line of research explores the optimization of collaborative structures. As a pioneer work, Fincon (Yu et al., 2024b) addresses stock trading and portfolio management using a hierarchical manager-analyst multi-agent system. This structure facilitates synchronous collaboration and employs self-criticism to monitor market risks and update investment theses, thereby achieving robust risk control. Notably, conceptualized beliefs are only selectively communicated among agents, effectively reducing the communication overhead typical in multi-agent systems. The importance of structured collaboration is also highlighted in TradingAgents (Xiao et al., 2025), which enhance automated trading performance through explicit role and objective allocation combined with streamlined information integration.

The most ambitious application in this domain involves creating comprehensive, closed-loop platforms and simulating entire economic environments. FinRobot (Yang et al., 2024b) implements a full-cycle financial analysis platform. At its agent layer, it uses CoT (Wei et al., 2022) to deconstruct complex financial problems, dynamically selecting or fine-tuning different LLMs and applying varied algorithms based on the task, thus enabling rapid market response. Pushing the boundaries further, large-scale simulations now aim to replicate real-world market dynamics. StockAgent (Zhang et al., 2024g) deploys a massive multi-agent system to simulate a stock trading environment, allowing users to assess how external factors influence investor behavior and profitability. Similarly, Gao et al. (Gao et al., 2024) simulates the stock market by creating agents equipped with unique profiles, observational capabilities, and tool-based learning. By integrating these agents with a realistic order-matching system, these frameworks achieve a high-fidelity simulation of actual stock market operations, opening new avenues for economic research and policy testing.

### 4.5. Others

Beyond the applications in mainstream scenarios, Agentic Reasoning Frameworks also demonstrate distinct potential in several other significant domains. Although agent-based approaches have not yet become mainstream in these fields, a growing body of pioneering work has begun to explore the frontiers of their capabilities in complex tasks like Embodied Interaction, GUI Operation, and Strategic Reasoning.

In Embodied Interaction, an agent’s reasoning process typically follows a perceive-plan-execute-memory cycle. The primary goal in this field is to empower agents to learn and complete tasks autonomously through continuous interaction with a virtual or physical environment (Liu et al., 2025a). For example, based on training-free framework, Voyager (Wang and Anandkumar, 2023) enables an agent to achieve lifelong learning in the game Minecraft by designing a specialized action space and a reasoning framework that integrates iterative feedback and continuous evolution. However, existing general foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) still show deficiencies in handling complex, multi-level task planning. Consequently, a prevailing research direction is to fine-tune base models for specific embodied scenarios to enhance the agent’s perception and planning capabilities in a tailored manner (Liu et al., 2025a).

GUI (Graphical User Interface) Operation aims to enable agents to operate applications on phones, computers, and the web with human-like proficiency (Zheng et al., 2024). Researchers usually build the framework base on state-of-the-art vision-language models like GPT-4V (Yan et al., 2023). They enhance reasoning frameworks by integrating visual memory and knowledge bases and introducing multi-agent collaboration mechanisms (Zhang et al., 2025e; Lee et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2024h, 2025g). These are combined with conventional components like reflection and context updating to effectively decompose complex GUI navigation tasks and enable continuous learning. However, as task complexity increases, the research focus is shifting from relying on the zero-shot capabilities of models towards more intensive, specialized training via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Wang et al., 2024d).

Strategic Reasoning requires an agent to understand and predict the behavior of opponents and dynamically adapt its own strategy, with the core challenge being the management of dynamics and uncertainty in multi-agent interactions. Currently, the research focus in this area is not on designing novel reasoning frameworks but rather on creating diverse test environments to accurately evaluate and enhance the strategic capabilities of LLMs (Zhang et al., 2024h). These environments span a wide range, as evidenced by the development of benchmarks based on real-time strategy (RTS) games like StarCraft II (Ma et al., 2024); the use of LLMs to generate expert-level decision explanations for board games (Kim et al., 2025a); and the systematic analysis of their behavioral rationality through classic game theory models (Fan et al., 2024).

## 5. Future Prospects

As discussed in previous chapters, agentic reasoning frameworks have made significant progress in both theory and application. However, the path to achieving a truly general, trustworthy, and efficient agent system is still full of challenges. In this chapter, we propose six potential directions for future development.

### 5.1. Scalability and Efficiency of Reasoning

As task complexity increases, the scalability and efficiency of agent frameworks have become major bottlenecks for large-scale applications. For instance, in multi-agent systems, poor task decomposition can cause system performance to degrade sharply as the system scales up (Cemri et al., 2025). Simply increasing the number of agents or extending reasoning time is often unsustainable, leading to spiraling costs and diminishing returns. Future works could focus on innovations at the framework level. On one hand, it will be crucial to design more efficient context management mechanisms for large-scale expansion. On the other hand, frameworks should also be equipped with dynamic task allocation and adaptive resource scheduling capabilities to handle complex tasks flexibly and efficiently.

### 5.2. Open-ended Autonomous Learning

Achieving open-ended autonomous learning is a key vision in agent research. The goal is to evolve agents from being mere “users” of existing knowledge into “creators” of new knowledge and tools (Gao et al., 2025a), breaking free from reliance on specific environments like games (Wang and Anandkumar, 2023). We have observed that current reasoning frameworks typically rely on static toolsets, fixed interaction logic, and pre-defined prompts. This rigidity constrains an agent’s creativity, potentially leading to poor performance on complex, zero-shot problems. Therefore, future framework design should focus on equipping agents with the ability to dynamically generate and optimize tools. This would allow them to autonomously create and iterate on their own methods during the reasoning process (Fei et al., 2025). Alongside this, there is also a need to establish an effective and reasonable evaluation system to assess an agent’s capacity for learning and creation in an open-ended world.

### 5.3. Dynamic Reasoning Framework

Improving a framework’s ability to adapt to complex tasks is crucial for the evolution of agents. Currently, this adaptability mainly involves making high-level adjustments for different types of tasks by setting up different collaboration architectures (Kim et al., 2025b). However, within the multi-step reasoning process of a single complex task, the collaboration pattern inside the framework often remains static. Future research should focus on a framework’s ability to self-regulate during the reasoning process for a single task. This requires the framework to have a deep understanding of its own reasoning process, enabling it to perceive the goal of the current step and dynamically reconfigure the interaction topology and collaboration protocols between agents. The framework should then be able to select and execute the optimal reasoning path to achieve the best balance between resource efficiency and reasoning quality.

### 5.4. Ethics and Fairness in Reasoning

Building trustworthy and responsible agent systems is an essential prerequisite for their deployment in the real world. As these systems become more autonomous and complex, individual biases may be amplified (Wang et al., 2024i), and it will become increasingly difficult to hold them accountable and correct flawed reasoning (Mu et al., 2025). Future research should focus on enhancing the framework’s ability to proactively manage bias. This means equipping it to anticipate, identify, and mitigate potential biases during the reasoning process itself. Additionally, the framework should be able to provide clear ethical justifications for every key decision, establishing a reliable pathway for external auditing and accountability.

### 5.5. Reliance and Safety in Reasoning

The safety challenges for agent frameworks have evolved from securing a single language model to protecting a complex, dynamic system composed of memory, planning, and tool interfaces. This shift introduces new risks: beyond traditional attacks on LLMs, every core module and external interface of an agent can become a new target. Attackers can exploit these entry points by poisoning API data to manipulate an agent’s “perception” or by hijacking its reasoning chain to control its “decisions”, leading to data leaks and more severe illicit operations (Wang et al., 2025i). Future work should approach the agent system as a whole at the framework level. By implementing dynamic, coordinated defenses between components, the system can quickly respond to and patch vulnerabilities, thereby enhancing its reliability and security.

### 5.6. Confidence Estimation and Explainable Agentic Reasoning

When an agent system becomes an automated decision-maker, it needs a precise way to evaluate and communicate the trustworthiness of its reasoning process. Future work should focus on establishing quantifiable mechanisms for uncertainty-aware confidence estimation. For instance, introspective reasoning could be conducted within an agentic framework to align internal uncertainty with inherent task ambiguity (Han et al., 2024a; Liang et al., 2024b). When faced with high uncertainty, an agent could actively seek information to clarify ambiguity (Hu et al., 2024a). Furthermore, calibrating the agent’s confidence during tool invocation is also crucial, since interactions with external environments and tools are major sources of uncertainty for agentic frameworks (Liu et al., 2024b). This would transform confidence evaluation from an agent’s unreliable self-declaration into a credible, objective proof, ensuring its safe deployment in critical fields.

## 6. Conclusion

With the explosive growth of large language model (LLM) based agentic reasoning methods and applications, a systematic understanding of these approaches and their scenarios has become crucial. We propose a unified taxonomy that breaks down agentic systems into three progressive levels, from single-agent methods, tool-based methods, to multi-agent systems. This framework offers a clear views through which to analyze the field. Building on this, we systematically reviewed how these frameworks are put into practice across major application domains, covering their core methodologies, key focuses, and evaluation approaches. Finally, we present our insights on the future directions of agentic reasoning, aiming to promote the development of agentic frameworks for the future generation.
