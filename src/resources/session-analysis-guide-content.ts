export const SESSION_ANALYSIS_GUIDE = `# Session Analysis Process

You have received structural metrics for a reasoning session. To perform qualitative analysis and extract learnings, follow this process:

## Step 1: Review Session Content

Call \`tb.session.get("<session-id>")\` via the \`thoughtbox_execute\` tool to retrieve the full session with all thoughts if you haven't already.

## Step 2: Identify Key Moments

Scan through the thoughts looking for:

1. **Pivots**: Where did reasoning direction change significantly?
2. **Decisions**: Which thoughts resolved uncertainty or chose between options?
3. **Insights**: Where did synthesis or "aha moments" occur?
4. **Revisions**: What corrections were made? (Check \`isRevision\` field)
5. **Branch Points**: Where did exploration diverge? (Check \`branchFromThought\` field)

## Step 3: Assess Significance

For each key moment identified, consider:
- **Impact**: How much did this thought influence the outcome?
- **Novelty**: Was this a new approach or standard reasoning?
- **Transferability**: Could this pattern apply to other problems?

## Step 4: Extract Learnings

Call \`tb.session.extractLearnings\` via \`thoughtbox_execute\` with your identified key moments:

\`\`\`javascript
async () => tb.session.extractLearnings("<session-id>", {
  keyMoments: [
    {
      thoughtNumber: 5,
      type: "decision",
      significance: 8,
      summary: "Chose hybrid approach over pure options"
    }
  ],
  targetTypes: ["pattern", "anti-pattern", "signal"]
})
\`\`\`

## Step 5: Generate Artifacts

The extractLearnings operation will generate:
- **Patterns**: From decisions and insights (for DGM experiments)
- **Anti-patterns**: From revisions (what didn't work)
- **Signals**: Session-level success/failure metrics

## Quality Indicators in Metrics

Use the structural metrics to guide your analysis:

| Metric | Interpretation |
|--------|----------------|
| High \`revisionRate\` | Look for anti-patterns - what needed correction |
| Low \`linearityScore\` | Look for branch exploration patterns |
| \`critiqueRequests\` > 0 | Check critique responses for quality signals |
| \`isComplete\` = true | Session reached natural conclusion |
| \`hasConvergence\` = true | Branching resolved to a decision |

## Key Moment Detection Heuristics

When scanning thoughts, look for these signals:

### Pivot Indicators
- Phrases like "actually", "wait", "on second thought"
- Significant shift in topic or approach
- Abandoning one line of reasoning for another

### Decision Indicators
- Explicit choices: "I'll go with", "choosing", "decided"
- Comparison conclusions: "X is better because"
- Commitment statements

### Insight Indicators
- Synthesis: "This means that", "so the pattern is"
- Connections: "This is related to", "similar to"
- Realizations: "I see now", "the key insight"

## Writing Effective Learnings

When providing key moments to \`tb.session.extractLearnings\`:

1. **Be specific**: Include the exact thought number
2. **Rate significance**: 1-10 scale helps prioritize
3. **Summarize why**: Brief explanation aids future retrieval
4. **Choose correct type**: decision, pivot, insight, revision, or branch

## Evolution Integration

Extracted learnings feed into the DGM evolution system:

- **Patterns** become experimental entries in \`.claude/rules/evolution/experiments/\`
- **Anti-patterns** document what to avoid
- **Signals** append to \`.claude/rules/evolution/signals.jsonl\`

Over time, successful patterns gain fitness and may be promoted to main rules.

> **Note on paths**: The \`.claude/rules/evolution/\` paths refer to the Claude Code memory system directory structure, not Thoughtbox internal paths. These are filesystem paths where the calling Claude Code agent stores learnings for its own memory system. Thoughtbox extracts the learnings; the agent decides where to persist them.
