export const THOUGHTBOX_CIPHER = `# Thoughtbox Compression Cipher

A formal protocol for structured reasoning. The cipher is not merely a compression format—it is a **protocol layer** that enables deterministic server-side processing of thought structure.

---

## The Cipher as Protocol

The cipher sits in the same conceptual space as MCP itself:

\`\`\`
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Natural language intent        │  ← Intelligence (client/agent)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  Thoughtbox Cipher              │  ← Protocol (formal contract)
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  MCP (tool calls, responses)    │  ← Protocol
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  HTTP/Transport                 │  ← Protocol
└─────────────────────────────────┘
\`\`\`

**Why this matters:**
- Intelligence transforms intent into cipher (agent's job)
- Everything below is protocol processing (deterministic)
- Server can parse cipher without inference—just contract fulfillment
- Using cipher = speaking the native protocol of Thoughtbox

When you write \`S47|H|S45|API latency ↑ bc db regression\`, you are encoding structure explicitly. The server extracts thought number, type, references, and relationships through parsing, not interpretation.

**The cipher enables:**
- Auto-inference of thought structure (no manual tracking of thoughtNumber, totalThoughts)
- Automatic link building from \`[SN]\` references
- Revision detection from \`^[SN]\` markers
- Relationship graphs from typed references

## Purpose

Every tool call consumes context tokens. Long reasoning chains risk exhausting the context window before reaching a conclusion. This cipher compresses reasoning content by 2-4x while remaining LLM-parseable and human-readable with reference to this legend.

## Step Type Markers

Single-character markers indicating the function of a reasoning step.

| Marker | Meaning | Usage |

| \`H\` | Hypothesis | Proposed explanation or prediction |
| \`E\` | Evidence | Facts, data, observations supporting/opposing |
| \`C\` | Conclusion | Determination reached from reasoning |

## Logical Operators

Standard notation LLMs recognize from training data.

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| \`→\` | implies, leads to, causes | \`A → B\` (A implies B) |
| \`←\` | derived from, because of | \`C ← E1,E2\` (C follows from E1 and E2) |
| \`∴\` | therefore | \`E1, E2 ∴ C\` |
| \`∵\` | because | \`C ∵ E1\` |
| \`∧\` | and | \`A ∧ B\` |
| \`∨\` | or | \`A ∨ B\` |
| \`¬\` | not | \`¬H1\` (H1 is false) |
| \`⊕\` | supports | \`E1 ⊕ H1\` (E1 supports H1) |
| \`⊖\` | contradicts | \`E2 ⊖ H1\` (E2 contradicts H1) |
| \`≈\` | approximately, similar to | \`result ≈ expected\` |
| \`≠\` | not equal, differs from | \`actual ≠ expected\` |
| \`>\` | greater than, stronger than | \`E1 > E2\` (E1 is stronger evidence) |
| \`<\` | less than, weaker than | |
| \`?\` | uncertain, unknown | \`outcome?\` |
| \`!\` | high confidence, confirmed | \`H1!\` |

---

## Reference Syntax

Steps reference prior steps by ID rather than restating content.

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| \`[S1]\` | references step 1 | \`C ← [S1],[S3]\` |
| \`[S1-S3]\` | references steps 1 through 3 | \`summary of [S1-S3]\` |
| \`[H1]\` | references hypothesis 1 | \`E1 ⊕ [H1]\` |
| \`+[S1]\` | builds on step 1 | \`+[S1] adding constraint\` |
| \`^[S1]\` | revises step 1 | \`^[S1] correction: X not Y\` |
| \`×[S1]\` | invalidates step 1 | \`×[S1] contradicted by E3\` |

---

## Confidence Markers

Append to any statement to indicate certainty level.

| Marker | Confidence | Example |
|--------|------------|---------|
| \`(!)\` | High (>90%) | \`H1 confirmed (!)\` |
| \`(?)\` | Low (<50%) | \`possible cause (?)\` |
| \`(~)\` | Medium (50-90%) | \`likely explanation (~)\` |
| \`(p=N)\` | Specific probability | \`success (p=0.7)\` |

## Step Format

Recommended structure for compressed reasoning steps:

\`\`\`
[ID]|[TYPE]|[REFS]|[CONTENT]
\`\`\`

**Examples:**

\`\`\`
S1|H|—|API latency ↑ bc db query regression
S2|E|S1|query metrics: p99 ↑3x on user lookup ⊕ [H1]
S3|E|S1|log vol ↑10%, w/in normal range ⊖ [H1] (insig)
S4|C|S1-S3|[H1] conf (!), investigate query Δ in deploy
\`\`\`

**Decoded:**
- S1: Hypothesis — API latency increased because of database query regression
- S2: Evidence supporting S1 — query metrics show p99 latency up 3x on user lookup, supports hypothesis 1
- S3: Evidence opposing S1 — log volume up 10%, within normal range, contradicts hypothesis 1 but insignificant
- S4: Conclusion from S1-S3 — Hypothesis 1 confirmed with high confidence, investigate query changes in deployment

---

## Telegraphic Style Guidelines

Beyond symbols, use telegraphic prose:

1. **Drop articles** — "the", "a", "an"
2. **Drop pronouns** — "it", "this", "that" (use refs instead)
3. **Drop helper verbs** — "is", "are", "was", "were", "has been"
4. **Use active fragments** — "query fails" not "the query is failing"
5. **Abbreviate common phrases** — see vocabulary table

**Before:**
> "The evidence suggests that the hypothesis about the database is probably correct, because the query metrics show a significant increase."

**After:**
> \`E ⊕ H1 (~): query metrics show sig ↑\`

---

## Usage Protocol

1. **Load cipher** — The cipher notation is available as a reference at \`thoughtbox://cipher\`
2. **Maintain consistency** — Once invoked, use notation throughout session
3. **Reference by ID** — Never restate prior content; use \`[SN]\` references
4. **Minimize response echo** — Thoughtbox returns only IDs; don't duplicate content
5. **Decode for output** — When producing final answer for user, expand to natural language

REFS:   [S1] ref step  +[S1] build on  ^[S1] revise  ×[S1] invalidate

CONF:   (!) high  (~) med  (?) low  (p=N) specific

## Multi-Agent Extension

When several agents reason in one workspace, the cipher's formal-logic
vocabulary pairs with two real coordination surfaces inside
\`thoughtbox_execute\`: **\`tb.claims.*\`** (durable claim graph) and
**\`tb.hub.*\`** (workspaces, problems, proposals, channels).

### Derivation Operators

| Symbol | Meaning | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| \`⊢\` | proves / syntactic entailment (turnstile) | \`P₁, P₂ ⊢ C\` (premises P₁ and P₂ prove conclusion C) |
| \`⊨\` | semantic entailment / models | \`M ⊨ φ\` (model M satisfies formula φ) |

### Claim Prefixes → tb.claims

Use the prefixes in thought text for human/agent readability, and mirror
load-bearing claims into the claim graph so other agents can find them:

| Prefix | Meaning | Durable form |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| \`CLAIM:\` | Assert a proposition | \`tb.claims.assert({ text, ... })\` |
| \`PREMISE:\` | Support for a claim | \`tb.claims.support({ claimId, evidence })\` |
| \`REFUTE:\` | Counter a claim | \`tb.claims.invalidate({ claimId, reason })\` |

A claim that only exists in prose is invisible to other agents. A claim in
the graph can be queried (\`tb.claims.query\`), linked, superseded, and its
downstream dependents surfaced (\`tb.claims.affected\`).

### Multi-Agent Derivation Format

\`\`\`
CLAIM: proposition text
PREMISE: [ref] supporting evidence
PREMISE: [ref] additional evidence
P₁, P₂ ⊢ C   (formal derivation)
\`\`\`

### Handling Disagreement

Conflicts are **not detected automatically** — surfacing a contradiction is
the agents' job:

1. Before asserting, check for existing claims on the same subject with
   \`tb.claims.query\`.
2. To contest another agent's claim, record the counter-evidence with
   \`tb.claims.invalidate\` (or assert a competing claim and \`tb.claims.link\`
   the two), and say so in the shared channel via \`tb.hub\` so the other
   agent sees it.
3. Use \`tb.claims.affected\` to find conclusions built on a claim you just
   invalidated — those need revisiting.

\`\`\`
Agent-A CLAIM: X causes Y
Agent-B REFUTE: [S3] ⊖ Agent-A/CLAIM bc counter-evidence
         → tb.claims.invalidate + hub channel note
\`\`\``;
