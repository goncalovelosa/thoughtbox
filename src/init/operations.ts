/**
 * Init Navigation Catalog
 *
 * Init has NO callable executor: there is no tb.init module and the Code Mode
 * catalog intentionally excludes init (see src/code-mode/search-tool.ts).
 * Every step below is performed by READING a thoughtbox://init URI; the
 * InitHandler read handler renders markdown that links to the next step.
 *
 * Entries therefore describe resource-navigation contracts (URI templates and
 * path parameters), not tool-call schemas.
