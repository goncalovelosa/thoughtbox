Thoughtbox notebooks are an evidence engine: executable Markdown artifacts that combine prose, code, deterministic validators, structured outputs, and replayable runs.

Use \`notebook_validate\` as the low-level predicate primitive. Use \`notebook_start_run\` to execute a notebook's cells and derive a mode-specific verdict from the real results (a pass/fail RunbookVerdict, or an EvalScorecard scored over declared expectations). Any mode marked **specified** below is designed but not yet runnable through \`notebook_start_run\` — it rejects explicitly; use \`notebook_run_cell\` and \`notebook_validate\` for cell-level evidence in those modes.

Additional evidence-flavoured authoring templates (simulation, failure capsule, ADR pack, skill certification, scenario factory, system audit) remain available through \`notebook_create\`'s \`template\` parameter as plain scaffolds without engine-run verdicts.

Runs execute synchronously in-process. Observatory integration is intentionally out of scope.
