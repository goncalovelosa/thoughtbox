# Agent Governance Substrate — Research and Design Notes

**Status**: DRAFT / research artifact
**Source**: Thoughtbox session `316ec05c-e2c0-4960-8322-05caf9708736` (2026-04-20)
**Not for implementation without user approval.** This directory is the durable record of a research session, not a committed plan.

## Why this exists

Across months of attempts, governance interventions in this repo have consistently produced outcomes that are the **inverse** of what was intended — protocols get stripped during refactors, rules accumulate as artifacts while real invariants drift, instruction-layer enforcement rots. The user asked: why does this happen, how do other AI-heavy teams avoid it, and what should the minimum-viable response look like for a solo operator?

This research session surveyed the empirical practice of Anthropic (Claude Code), OpenAI (Codex Harness), Stripe (Minions), Factory AI (Missions), GitHub Copilot, and Sourcegraph Amp; grounded the findings in theory (Goodhart taxonomy, specification gaming, Letta sleep-time compute, Lehman's laws, Scott's legibility trap); dug into this repo's own git history to understand what was actually tried here; and produced a concrete path forward sized for one person.

## Contents

- **SPEC-SEVEN-LAYER-ARCHITECTURE.md** — The convergent architecture used by every successful AI-heavy team.
- **SPEC-THOUGHTBOX-SLEEP-TIME.md** — Supabase-native proposal: adopt Letta's sleep-time compute pattern as the async governance substrate, running on pgmq + pg_cron infrastructure already shipped in migration `20260408033928`.
- **SPEC-EVOLUTION-CHECK-GENERALIZED.md** — Generalize the existing `thoughtbox://prompts/evolution-check` pattern (A-Mem-based) from thoughts to skills, specs, rules, and memories. This is the mechanism by which governance moves from friction to search-space-narrowing.
- **STARTER-TIER-A.md** — The concrete starter actions sized for a solo operator. MVP is A1 (branch protection) + B5 (outbound claim truth layer), ~2 hours total.

## Core finding, 60 words

The user's observed pattern is predicted by Goodhart Adversarial and specification gaming. The defining property of successful teams' response is that **governance lives outside the agent-editable surface**. Every intervention this repo has attempted lived inside the repo, where agents can navigate and strip it. Moving governance to platform-level perms, CI gates, and sleep-time-agent memory updates breaks the inverse-outcome dynamic.

## Notebook artifacts

- **Stewardship Scorecard** (`pnlzgfld6mk`) — runnable notebook. Current state: 7 / 21 (33%). Biggest gap: L5 multi-agent adversarial review (0/3).
- **MVP Starter** (`jtl0qpq77i9`) — exported to `prototypes/stewardship-mvp-starter.src.md`. Generates Tier A checklist + branch protection script + CODEOWNERS file.

## Status disclaimer

These are research notes. Nothing here is accepted. Moving any of this into implementation requires the HDD process (staging ADR → validation → accept/reject). Cross-reference `AGENTS.md` and the `hdd` skill before committing to any of these directions.
