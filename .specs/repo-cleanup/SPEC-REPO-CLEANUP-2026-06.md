claims:

    statement: The cleanup series removes only revalidated dead or unsupported repo artifacts while preserving currently authoritative assets such as `.agents/` and `FileSystemStorage`.
    type: governance
    behavioral: false
    required_evidence: "Cleanup tracker, per-branch diffs, and validation notes show deletions were revalidated and `.agents/` plus filesystem storage were intentionally retained."
  - id: c2
    statement: The cleanup series revalidates stale configuration drift and leaves no broken `start:stateful` script or stale Vitest include path for `automation-self-improvement/agentops/tests/`.
    type: implementation
    behavioral: false
    required_evidence: "`package.json` and `vitest.config.ts` on the cleanup branches show the broken script is absent and the include path targets `automation-self-improvement/agentops/tests/`, with validation notes recorded in the tracker."
  - id: c3
    statement: Research workflow assets become reproducible from tracked text sources under `research-workflows/`, and the repository no longer relies on a tracked mutable SQLite binary as the authoritative seed artifact.
    type: implementation
    behavioral: false
    required_evidence: "`research-workflows/schema.sql` and `seed.sql` define the durable model, regeneration instructions exist, and `research-workflows/workflows.db` is removed from git tracking."
  - id: c4
    statement: Repo docs and cleanup governance artifacts explicitly record accepted cleanup decisions, validation evidence, and deferred items so later sessions can continue without re-auditing the same scope.
    type: governance
    behavioral: false
    required_evidence: "The tracker and plan artifacts under `cleanup/` document decisions, branch breakdown, validation commands, audit corrections, and follow-up items."
  - id: c5
    statement: The cleanup series aligns repo authority docs with current source by removing stale loop-embedding claims from the README, changelog, and `.specs` index docs while preserving currently wired spec-workflow prompt documentation.
    type: governance
    behavioral: false
    required_evidence: "The updated README, CHANGELOG, `.specs/README.md`, and `.specs/IMPLEMENTATION-READY.md` match current source presence for spec prompts and absence of loop embedding assets."

## Repository Cleanup Execution Plan (June 2026)

This spec governs the cleanup series initiated from the 2026-05-29 repo audit.
The user approved the execution sequence, the shadow-tracker approach, and the
key ambiguity collapses that narrowed the scope.

## Scope locks

- Preserve `.agents/` because current `AGENTS.md` treats it as a tool-neutral
  fallback.
- Preserve `FileSystemStorage` for this cleanup series.
- Normalize `research-workflows/` instead of deleting it.
- Revalidate each delete target immediately before removal.

## Approved execution units

1. Tracker/bootstrap artifacts
2. Tier 1 safe cleanup and stale config fixes
3. Docs and authority alignment
4. Research workflow normalization before deleting stale regeneration copies
5. Archive/delete stale prototype clusters
6. Remove unsupported runtime surfaces (`.gemini/`, `.pi/`, local observability)
7. Branch cleanup, with remote deletions performed only from an explicit list

## Evidence model

Each branch in the cleanup series records:

- exact files changed
- validation commands run
- audit corrections discovered during revalidation
- follow-up items that remain out of scope
